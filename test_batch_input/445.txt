One day, Jack told his friend. Tom , that he loved a very beautiful girl with charming eyes and long hair, and that he wanted to marry her. Tom was so happy to hear the news and asked Jack to lead him to her. However, Tom loved her at first sight, He then told Jack, "This girl is not suitable for you. She deserves a handsome man like me." Jack was astonished and struggled with Tom until they went to the police to solve the problem.
They told the policeman their story. The policeman asked them to bring the girl to his office. 
However, when the policeman saw her, he became taken with her and said, "This girl is not suitable for you two. She deserves someone with a status like me." The three men struggled with each other and then went to the king.
The king asked them to bring him the girl. When the king saw the girl, he said, "Oh, the girl should marry a king like me." They all argued with each other. 
Then the girl said, "I have a solution. I'm going to run and you'll run after me. I'll be the wife to the one who catches me first." The four men all agreed and ran after her. While running after her, they suddenly fell into a deep hole. From the top, the girl looked at them and said, "Now, let me tell you who I am."
"I'm Reputation--I'm the one all people run after. They compete against each other to get me . They leave principles aside to seek for me, and they are sure to fall like you !"
