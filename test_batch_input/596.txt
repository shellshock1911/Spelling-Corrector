  My name is Mike Smith. I play with many fridens and everybody has appreciated and enjoyed playing with it. We have an older version and a newer one. The older one has easier phrases. The newer one has mnore phrases so it is a little more difficult for people to play with.The buttons on the newer one are very clearly marked so mistakes don't happen. The older one had a vocie that would announce the score of each team and at the end would say "team 1 (or 2) wins!".The newer one just displays this information on the previously mentioned tiny screen. Overall this is a game that is well worth having at home.
