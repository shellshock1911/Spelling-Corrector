Located on Turkey's famous, 500 km Lycian Way arid only accessible by water,the 86,000 sqm Butterfly Valley is home to roughly 100 species of butterflies,including the orange,black and white Jersey Tiger.
The Turkish government named the valley a preservation area in 1987 to protect the butterflies and local plants-a distinction that lias protected the valley from the fate of its better-known neighbour,Oludeniz,a beach resort 5 km north.
Oludeniz remained actually unknown until travellers began camping there in the 1980s. Today,it's a particularly depressing example of paradise lost .The town is filled with neon lights and English-themed restaurants.The beach is crowded with drunken,sunburned tourists,and the clear skies are polluted with seemingly infinite paraglider from the surrounding green mountains.
In contrast,the Anatolia Tourism Development Cooperative bought Butterfly Valley from the villagers of Faralya in 1981 and opened it for tourism in 1984.Three years later,when the government deemed the valley a national preservation area,the Cooperative made the construction of permanent buildings illegal.
Today,they allow only tents and small houses,and they've focused on natural growth as opposed to commercial.Plants,like olives,pomegranates,lemons,oranges,grapes,walnuts,peaches,apricots,palm,oleander and laurel,all thrive here.
For eight months a year-between April and Novembera small and diverse group of hippies and backpackers come over to the valley,where days are marked by sunrise and sunset yoga practices and evenings by music sessions. Once mid-afternoon hits,after the few tour boats are gone for the day,Butterfly Valley belongs to those who are willing to spend the night under the stars,living wonderfully free of the more luxurious conveniences of Oludeniz.
