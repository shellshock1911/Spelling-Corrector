There is a wonderful story about a young girl who had no family and no one to love her.
One day,feeling very sad and lonely,she was walking through a grassland when she noticed a small butterfly caught in a thorn   bush. The young girl carefully released the butterfly. Instead of flying away,the little butterfly changed into a beautiful fairy. The young girl rubbed her eyes in disbelief.:
"For your wonderful kindness," the good fairy said to the girl,"I will give you any wish you would like." The little girl thought for a moment and then replied,"I want to be happy."
The fairy leaned toward her and whispered in her ear. Then the fairy disappeared.:
As the little girl grew up,there was no one in the land as happy as she. Everyone asked her secret of happiness .She would only smile and answer,"The secret of my happiness is that I listened to a good fairy when I was a little girl.":
When she was very old and on her deathbed,the neighbors all gathered around her,and feared that her unbelievable secret of happiness would die with her. "Tell us,please," they begged,"Tell us what the good fairy said." The lovely old woman simply smiled and said,"She told me that everyone,no matter how secure they seemed,no matter how old or young,how rich or poor,had need of me."
