The Worst Part
Mom is usually home on Sunday but this week she was going to a big golf game and I was all alone in the house. I was mad at Mom for divorcing Dad.
I kept looking at the telephone until I couldn't stand it any longer. I picked up the receiver and dialed Dad's number over in Bakersfield. I even remembered to dial 1 first because it was long distance. "You promised to phone me this week but you didn't," I said, feeling I had to talk to him.
"Take it easy, kid," he said. "I just didn't get around to it. I was going to call this evening. The week isn't over yet."
I thought about that.www.ks5u.com
"Something on your mind?" he asked.
"I hoped you would call, so I waited and waited." Then I was sorry I said it.
"There was heavy snow in the morning," he said, "I had to chain up on highway 80 and lost time."
I know putting chains on eight big wheels in the snow is no fun.I felt a little better, as long as we were talking. "How is Bandit?" I asked.
There was a funny silence. For a minute I thought the line was dead. Then I knew something must have happened to my dog.
"Well, kid--", he began. "My name is Leigh!" I almost yelled. "I'm not just some kid you met on the street!"
"Keep your shirt on, Leigh," he said. "When I had to stop along with some other truckers to put on chains, I left Bandit out of the cab, I thought he would get back ... I have sent out a call to CB radio, but I didn't get an answer yet." I was about to say I understood when there came the bad part, the really bad part. I heard a boy's voice say, "Hey, Bill, Mom wants to know when we're going out to get the pizza?"www.ks5u.com
