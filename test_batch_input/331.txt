Jean Francis Grander was perhaps the most daring man who ever lived and perhaps the craziest. His greatest desire was to entertain and amaze people. He measured his success by the number of people who fainted dead away after witnessing his death-defying feats. 
Grander,a blond Frenchman,toured North America in 1850,billing himself as "Blondin". Blondin's  gift was excellent balance. This talent. coupled with a great desire to surprise and shock his audiences,made Blondin an incomparable performer. 
His most famous  _ was walking acrossprefix = st1 /Niagara Fallson a tightrope. Blondin's "stage" consisted of a rope tied 1,100 feet across the falls. The rope hung some 160 feet above the rocks and boiling water below the falls. 
Simply walking across the falls was not exciting enough for Blondin;he later had to ride across on a bicycle. Then,in another performance,he calmly walked across blindfolded . At still another time,he carried his terrified manager on his back and walked over the falls before thousands of breathless audience. 
But Blondin was undoubtedly his own worst critic. He was never satisfied with hfs act and always tried to attract his audience with his balancing feat. One of his most daring walks was made in the darkness of night. Blondin became so famous on his tour through North America that his last performance was attended by an admiring Prince of Wales.
