A growing number of students in the United States are studying Mandarin . It is the official language of China. More and more people speak Mandarin than those who speak other languages in the world.
Schools that teach Mandarin want to prepare students for a future in which they are likely to work with people from China. Business in China is booming , and that trend  is expected to grow.
The US government is trying to encourage even more public schools to teach Mandarin. Officials are considering spending about $1 billion on Mandarin programs in schools. China is getting involved  too. The Chinese government has _ Mandarin textbooks to US schools. Some schools are also taking part in teacher exchange programs with China.
"It is important for students to learn Mandarin and Chinese culture," said Mary Patterson, a school principal  in Portland, Oregon. "Students who do so will have wider opportunities when they become adults."
