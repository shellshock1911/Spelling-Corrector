Blogs   are the place where young people go to show their hearts, to express their anger, sorrow or disappointment, and even to gossip  .
Many people enjoy the freedom in blogging. Some, however, find that putting one's life online can have a price. The blogs of some students in America were stopped by the government for some time because they posted threatening words to their teachers on their blogs.
A recent study finds that nearly a fifth of teens who surf the Internet have their own blogs. And 38 % of teens say they read other people's blogs. By comparison, about a tenth of adults have their own blogs and a quarter say they read other people's online magazines.
With the development of the Internet, more and more people will be attracted by blogging.
In another study, 79% of teens agree that people at their age aren't careful enough when giving out information about themselves online. Besides, careless blogging can also influence blog readers. When you are angry or unhappy, your blog is the first place you turn to. The words you post then may not be _ which you may regret later. To minimize   the negative influence, change the safety setting and make such posts "personal" so that only you can read them.
As long as you are careful with what you post, blogging is a great means of staying in touch with friends and displaying one's creative works.
