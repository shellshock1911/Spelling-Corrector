On Saturday, Feb 12, 2000, two things happened that changed my life.
First of all, my baby sister got married. She was 26 this day, and yet to me she was still my baby sister.
I was happy, but also sad. Gone were the days of me bossing  her around. My bossy behavior had once earned me the nickname Lucy. If you're a fan of Peanuts, then you can clearly imagine my behavior as an older sister.
At one point, I left the wedding reception to get some air. I went outside and walked to a nearby playground. I'm not sure how long I sat there before my sister came and joined me. We talked about how we were both grown up. As she wiped a tear from my eye, she lovingly said, "You'll always be Lucy to me." We hugged.
Then, my cousin Mike walked over to tell us that it was time to cut the cake, and the second thing that changed my life that day came to pass.
"Hey, did you guys hear that Charles Schulz died today?" he said casually - as if it were no big deal. Then he took my sister's arm and they turned to head back to the reception hall. "Coming?" they asked. "In a minute," I replied, and I sat back down on the bench, dizzy from what Mike had just told me.
How could Charles Schulz be dead? He was my creator! He was almost like a father to me!
I had lost so many things on that day. My innocence had slipped away like a thief in the night. It was gone before I could do anything about it, taking with it all the treasures that I had held in my heart. I felt myself grow up in an instant. I saw, for the first time, what I really was - a 30-year-old woman with a husband of my own, and soon, a child of my own.
I took a deep breath and stood up from the bench. I turned and headed back to the hall, hoping I hadn't missed the cutting of the cake. It was the day that my sister grew wings of her own and left the nest - the day that _ .
