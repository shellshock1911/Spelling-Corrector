When a friend is sad about a tragedy ,it's hard to know how to comfort  him/ her. But the worst thing you can do is say nothing. It could mean that you don't care. You don't have to say much.. A single supportive phrase doesn't require absolutely perfect words to break the ice. Here are some conversation starters when life difficult situations
1. A friend loses his baby.
Don't say: "Don't worry. You're so young. You'll have another baby." Do say: " I'm so sorry. I can't begin to imagine what you are going through, but if you want to talk about it, call me anytime."
2. A guy deserts your friend.
Don't say: "I never liked that rat bastard   anyway!" ( If the couple winds up reconciling  , you could end up losing your friend.) Do say: "Breaking up is always hard to deal with, but I'm here for you, whatever you need."
3. A friend has a death in the family.
Don't say: "It's God's will." or "I know exactly how you feel." Do say: "I'm sorry about your loss. What can I do to help?"
4. A friend loses a job suddenly.
Don't say: "Work is always boring. Those bosses didn't suit you!" Do say: "I'm sorry for that, but I know there's an even better job waiting for you there. Let's think about possibilities."
5. Someone's pet dies.
Don't say: "Gee! It was only a cat!" or "My roommate doesn't like her dog and she is getting rid of her dog. Do you want it?" Do say: "I'm sorry, she was such a great cat. How long did you have it?"
