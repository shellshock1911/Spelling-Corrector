Like many other teenage boys, Jones loved sports. But at 5 feet, 175 pounds, he found his weight a trouble. His doctor wanted him to lose 50 pounds so that he may catch up with the football game by the end of summer.
Jones chose the popular dance Revolution video game at home to increase his activity. He had lost about 10 pounds by changing his diet. Now, after two weeks playing the game, he has lost another 10!
In West Virginia, 43% of the nearly 6,000 children examined for heart disease risk were considered over-weighted; more than 25% were too fat. "we are in a crisis of childhood _ not only in West Virginia but in America," said a researcher.
Researchers are looking at the potential for improving effects by using the game. A teacher in West Virginia has been using the video game in her classes since last fall. She reported that the game does improve heart health as well as eye-hand coordination, and her students take the video game as a great alternative to jumping rope or ball games.
The US Education Department is putting the game in 20 schools to control childhood obesity. Well, are you going to try such a game to dance away your extra weight?
