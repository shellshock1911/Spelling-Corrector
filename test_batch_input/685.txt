Most lives saved from sinking ferryCao Min couldn't believe she was experiencing exactly what she had seen years ago in the film "Titanic".
Cao and her two children from Anhui Province were traveling on board the "Liaoludu 7"on February 22.They were among the first people on the ship who were rescued by lifeboats. Cao's one-year-old son was the youngest passenger on board.
The "Liaoludu 7"was traveling in the Bohai Straits from Lushun in Liaoning Province to the port city of Longkou in Shandong Province. It suddenly lost its power at 2:30 pm and tilted on its side. With 81 people on board, the ferry began to sink.
"I was so scared that my legs couldn't move forward. They kept shaking even when I was asked to jump onto a " lifeboat." Cao recalled.
Upon receiving the urgent appeal, China Marine Search and Rescue Center immediately informed the State Council .The center sent eight lifeboats to the sinking ship and asked for help form the Ministry of Agriculture, the Navy and nearby fishing boats.
After more than four hours of fighting against strong winds and freezing ocean water, the passengers were recovered. All but four survived. These four died after spending too long in the freezing waters, according to a spokesperson for the Beijing-based center.
