My first day of high school was like any other first day: registering? finding new classmates, meeting new teachers, and seeking new friends.
During lunch, I ran into my first snag of the day.At the dining hall, as the checkout lady asked for my money, I realized that I had forgotten my lunch money  .When I told her about it, I heard a voice behind me.I turned around and there stood a teacher telling her he would pay for my lunch.He told me his name, Mr.Pete Walker, and said, "If you get a chance, you should take my history class." I recognized his name, and told him I was in his class later that day.Mr.Walker befriended me on the.very first clay of school at a very crucial time of the day--lunch !
He always told us we should do more than we ever thought.he pushes us to clod all things better.He coached many sports, and sponsored many after-class activities.If we were interested in something, he would find a way to expose us to it by inviting speakers, taking us on field trips, or obtaining information for us.
Two years later, my junior year in school was clicking along nicely when one day I was riding my motorcycle and I was hit by a car. I spent six days in hospital and was at home in bed for two weeks before returning to school.Mr.Walker stopped by the hospital each day with my work from my teachers. Once  I was at home, he would bring my work too.
After high school, I attended the United States Army Airborne School in Fort I3enning, Georgia.I knew my parents woolly be there the day I graduates, but they brought an unexpected guest.They came across Mr.Walker at lunch several days before and told him I was about to graduate.His visit, however, was not a surprise to me.
