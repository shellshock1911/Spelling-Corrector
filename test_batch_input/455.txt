When you are admitted to a local university, especially one without accommodation, perhaps you'll live at home and become a commuting student which benefits you. It's cheaper and you can have a comfortable and familiar situation, which means you'll enjoy home meals you're used to instead of the changeless food in the university cafe.
However, commuting students need to try their best to get involved in the life of their college and to take special steps to meet their fellow students. Often, this means you should be active to seek out and talk to people in your classes whom you think you might like.
One problem that commuting students sometimes face is their parents' unwillingness to recognize that they're adults. The change from high school to college is a big one, and if you live at home you need to develop the same kind of independence you'd have when you were living away. Home rules that might have been appropriate when you were in high school don't apply. If your parents are reluctant to renegotiate, you can speed the process along by letting your behavior show that you have the responsibility that goes with maturity. Parents are more willing to acknowledge their children as adults when they behave like adults. If, however, there's so much friction  at home that it disturbs your academic work, you might want to consider sharing an apartment with one or more friends. Sometimes this is a happy solution when family tensions make everyone miserable.
