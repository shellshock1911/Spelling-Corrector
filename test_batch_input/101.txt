If man's best friend is a dog, then who is a dog's best friend? That would be Rover, Glow, Ivan or Raina. They recently donated   blood to other dogs. And they did it without having to travel far from home: they visited an animal bloodmobile.
Like the Red Cross vehicles for humans, the University of Pennsylvania's traveling vet lab goes to where the donors are to make it easier to give. The bloodmobile makes weekly rounds through Philadelphia and New Jersey.
Like humans, not every dog is qualified  to donate blood. The dogs are examined for health first. Dogs must have the correct blood type, weigh at least 55 pounds and be under 8 year old. About 150 dogs take part in the program. Each donates three or four pints  a year, which can help animals suffering from illness like cancer or an accident like being hit by a car.
Sandy Lucas brought her 7-year-old dog, Raina, to the bloodmobile last week. She said she wouldn't have taken the dog to Penn Vet's animal hospital in downtown Philadelphia, which is twice as far from her home. "I was very, very excited that she had the right blood that was needed to help another dog out," said Lucas. "We'll surely do it again."
Just like people, the donors get a snack and a heart-shaped sticker immediately after giving. What's more, they receive dog food to take home.
If dogs are doing what they can to save other dogs, why can't we do it to save other people? Next time you hesitate  over whether to donate blood or not, think of the dogs.
