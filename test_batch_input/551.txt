Happiness can mean different things to different people. For example, for one person, it may mean being in a relationship, while for someone else it may mean feeling you have the ability to handle whatever life throws at you.
     While you might think that there are certain things that make you happy (or could make you happy if you had them), research has shown that there are certain common qualities among happy people--and it isn't necessarily what you might have thought.
     You might think that happy people have lots of money, are physically attractive or have great jobs. Or, you might just think happy people are simply lucky, and are bom that way.
     Research suggests, however, that there are a number of variables  that make a far greater contribution to happiness than outer and more superficial factors .
    That doesn't mean that if you have a lot of money you won't be happy, or that having a lot of money is bad, it just means that other factors are more important in determining happiness. In fact, a strong positive relationship between wealth and happiness only exists for those who live below the poverty line and/or who are unemployed.
     What makes happy people different from the others is that they have a different attitude-a different way of thinking about things and doing things. They  _ the world in a different way, and go about their lives in a different way.
