Dear Water--Use It Wisely,
More and more water is getting wasted each day. I want to help out and teach people how to conserve water. Please continue reading because your organization is very influential. I had an idea that you could send some workers from your organization to schools all around the world, and they could inform the students about water usage.
Did you know that every minute, 1,000,000,000(one billion) tons of water falls to the earth from rain? We are lucky to have rainwater. It helps fill up our lakes. There is about 326,000,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water on Earth. Yes, this is tons, but it is getting wasted.
Everyone needs water. So why waste it? I think it is very irresponsible to let the water run when you are not at home. We can use water with respect by making good choices. Take a shower instead of a bath, use an automatic dishwasher instead of hand washing. You can buy Earthfriendly cleaner spray, so that our drinking water will not be polluted. If your washer isn't full, then don't start it. With water being wasted every day, by the time we get to the 3000s we are going to have to survive on milk and juice! Won't that be boring? That means we will have to give our dogs a bowl of juice instead of water with their food. I mean, come on,we're talking real life here!
Water wasting needs to come to a stop and without delay. Water-Use It Wisely, PLEASE inform people about their water usage! It plays a big role in my life. It would be really great if you take part in spreading the news about this! Thanks tons!
