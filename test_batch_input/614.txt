China improved the quality health care to its population, but observers say continued reforms are still needed to solve the problems caused by high costs and uneven ( ) spread.
O'Leary, a Britain-based medical researcher who focuses on China, is "greatly impressed" by Being's success in making sure the insurance programmers cover a very large percentage of the population.  But he says medical costs are still high, even for  _ ."So when health care costs are higher there are still out-of-pocket expenses, and that remains a major challenge," he says.Observers say out-of-pocket expenses are not affordable for many in rural areas, where a serious illness can make lower-income residents fall into poverty.
Another challenge is the uneven spread of China's health care reform.Compared with the urban areas many rural areas are still served by medical workers with little training."At the village level rural doctors are often people who don't have regular medical training.But they're often providing all the services for the poorest people." says O'Leary.
High drug prices, a lack of qualified doctors and nurses, and an aging population are still the problems as China improves its health care system.
China says that its healthcare system still fall far short of the public's demands for healthcare as well as the requirements of economic and social development.But many observers, including O'Leary, agree that China is making steady and positive progress toward providing quality health care for its citizens."They are moving in the right direction," says O'Leary."Trying to provide a universal health care system for 1.3 billion people is a huge task.But China will surely do better with its continuous efforts."
