The organizers of the Beijing Olympics have predicted every aspect of the preparatory work and are making every effort to fulfill their task for 2007.
Competition schedule finalized
The competition schedule for the 28 sports and 302 events has been settled already.The detailed daily schedule will be made in the final three months before the Olympics,due to the arrangements to be made for TV broadcasters.
1,000 cultural events expected
Beijing is expected to hold as many as 1,000 Olympicsrelated cultural activities,including highlevel exhibitions and art performances,presentations of foreign art troops,community cultural squares,and promotions by sponsors and cohost cities.
30,000 journalists to cover the Olympics
More than 30,000 journalists are expected to come to Beijing during the Games.They pose a great challenge to the organizers in terms of how to meet their specific news coverage demands.
Two million visitors to test Beijing's services
At least two million Chinese and half a million foreign tourists are expected to visit Beijing during the Olympics.Taking into account another 50,000 athletes and media,accommodation is a big challenge,too.122 Beijingbased starclass hotels were signed for the purpose in 2006.But how can they make 10,000 rooms available for _ and 160,000--180,000 rooms for overseas visitors?The organizers are trying to find solutions to the problem in 2007.
Hot tickets,low prices
In previous Olympics,onethird of the tickets were hot,another one third were breakeven and the remaining one third were unwillingly received.In contrast,most of the Beijing Olympic tickets have been hot,according to the ticketing program so far.The most expensive ticket for the opening ceremony stands only at 5,000 yuan--the lowest prices seen in recent editions of the Olympics.
