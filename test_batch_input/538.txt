Attitudes to AIDS Now
Most people say that the USA is making progress in fighting AIDS, but they don't know there's no cure and strongly disagree that "the AIDS epidemic is over," a new survey finds.
The findings, released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, reassure activists who have worried that public concern about AIDS might disappear in light of recent news about advances in treatment and declines in deaths.
 "While people are very optimistic about the advances, they're still realistic about the fact that there is no cure" says Sophia Chang, director of HIV programs at the foundation.
 The Kaiser survey, like a recent USA TODAY Gallup Poll, does find that the number of people ranking AIDS as the country's top health problem has fallen. In the Kaiser Poll, 38% say it's the top concern, down from 44% in a 1996 poll; in the Gallup Poll, 29% say AIDS in No.1, down from 41% in 1992 and 67% in 1987.
 Other findings from Kaiser, which polled more than 1,200 adults in September and October and asked additional questions of another 1,000 adults in November:
 52% say the country is making progress against AIDS, up from 32% in 1995.
 52% say the government spends too little on AIDS.
 86% correctly say AIDS drugs can now lengthen lives; an equal number correctly say that the drugs are not cures.
 67% incorrectly say that AIDS deaths increased or stayed the same in the past year; 24% know deaths fell.
 Daniel Zingale, director of AIDS Action Council, says, "I'm encouraged that the American people are getting the message that the AIDS epidemic isn't over. I hope the decision-makers in Washington are getting the same message... We have seen signs of complacency .
