Cell phones with cameras are really a popular way to capture a moment in time, but some "clever" students found another use--capturing tests as a way to cheat.
The Magnolia Independent School District in Montgomery County has added camera phones to a list of electronic devices   students are _ at school.
School officials said the move was made as a preventative measure to stop potential   test cheaters, since students could use the phones to snap pictures of test questions. Another concern was that students might take inappropriate   pictures of classmates to later share or post on a website. Cell phones without cameras are allowed on campus, but must be turned off. Camera cell phones will be taken away from students if found on campus, and disciplinary action will be taken, officials said.
Some students were unhappy to hear about the ban. "I'd be lost without my phone," said Kendall Paul, a Magnolia High School student. "All my numbers are in it. I've never used it to cheat and I don't know anyone who has at our school, so I think it's kind of stupid. " But other students said they saw _ all the time at their school.
"You would take a picture of the test and then send it to the next person taking the test," said Melissa Sparks, a student.
"They would send the question and the answer, or just the number of the question and the answer. It's quicker that way," another student said.
Parents often provide their children with cell phones for use in emergencies and to keep in better touch with them. "My Mom wants me to have my phone with me all the time for emergency purpose. So, it goes with me wherever I go," Paul said.
