Some unfortunate people are rather attractive to mosquitoes, while the smell of some lucky people drives the blood-suckers away. Now the smelly chemicals from the sweat of these lucky people have been identified by researchers, who are testing its effectiveness as a natural mosquito repellent  .
Everybody produces a mixture of chemicals with smells in their sweat, some of which attract biting insects. But people who do not get bitten also produce smelly chemicals that appear to mask the smells of the attractive chemicals.
This masking is very effective in avoiding a mosquito's bite, explains James Logan, a scientist who carried out the research with his colleagues.
These helpful chemicals probably occur naturally in everybody's sweat but some people have a much higher ratio   than others.
"It's very exciting," prefix = st1 /Logansays, "because these are totally natural chemicals with an effectiveness that compares favorably to other chemicals such as DEET, which is the best repellent available but has unwanted side effects."
A key chemical identified by Loganas a repellent is also "a natural food additive which has been proven safe". He says, "And because it can be made by plants, it may one day be possible to mass-produce it cheaply."
The repellent is currently being tested by 16 volunteers in Africa. Meanwhile, the researchers are testing the repellent against other biting insects.
