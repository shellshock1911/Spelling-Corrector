Police in prefix = st1 /Hangzhouyesterday claimed to have arrested 11 people suspected of running an illegal gambling network.  
"The network acted as a bridge between Chinese gamblers and overseas casinos ," said Wu Jun, spokesman for the public security bureau of Xiaoshan district, Hangzhou. "About 80 percent of the gamblers are local businessmen, and chances are that the money they bet came from their companies' accounts," Wu said. The underground gambling network was set up by a wealthy local businessman surnamed Li last year, he said. The gamblers could view real-time images of a casino in Philippinesvia the website and place bets through the agent's account.  
Li registered with the website after coughing up a 5-million-yuan deposit last March. Every time a gambler won, 17% of the winning amount would go to the website as a fee. Li received 10% of the winnings as  _ , while the person who introduced the gambler to the website got a 7-percent commission.  
Li ran the gambling network under a pyramid scheme. Gamblers were encouraged to bring in more people to join the website's network in order to earn more commission.  
"Li had provided a convenient but illegal platform for wealthy businessmen, who wanted to gamble," Wu said. "Otherwise they had to travel all the way to Macaoto do so." Under the current law, gambling is prohibited all overChina, exceptMacao. "Setting up the gambling network is the stupidest thing I've ever done," Li said. "The whole thing started as a joke, but the joke went too far," he added. "I was not short of money, I was just being greedy."  
According to Wu, the police uncovered the illegal network while investigating a local businessman, who fled without paying banks "hundreds of millions of yuan" worth of debt. The cops later discovered the man lost most of the bank's money in Li's virtual casino.
