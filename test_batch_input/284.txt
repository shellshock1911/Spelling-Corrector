Whatever field we are involved in,we always have to look for ways to expand our knowledge.An increase in knowledge in a particular subject can lead to a better understanding,grasp,judgment,intelligence and ability in that area.So how do we go about gaining knowledge?
I think people are the biggest source of knowledge for anybody.Right from childhood,we have learned things by watching others.Whatever field you want to gain knowledge in,there must be many who have experience in that field.So make use of this valuable source of information by learning from the experience,success,mistakes and skills of others. Study carefully and associate with people who are experts in the field you want to gain knowledge in.
The next best source of knowledge should be books.There are millions and millions of books in every language and on almost any topic imaginable.Whatever problem you are facing must have been faced by somebody else before,and its solution is likely to have been preserved in the form of a book.If you are serious about gaining knowledge about a topic,then read any book,magazine,article etc.You can lay your hands on the books related to that topic.Read as much as you can.
It is said that experience is a great teacher,so learn from your past experience and the experience of others.Learn from your and others' past and present achievements as well as mistakes.
Experimenting with new things and observing new things can help you learn very quickly. Keep in mind,though,that while experimenting,you may encounter a few failures , too.Do not become discouraged as failures are a part of the learning curve,especially while attempting something new.Try to earn from failures instead of becoming disheartened.
