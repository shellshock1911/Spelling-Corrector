Sahnun Mohamud has never lived in Somalia,but the 21-year-old student has helped set  up an organization that supports aid projects for the east-African country.Sahnun Mohamud is  a co-founder and director of a group called Students for Somalia. He is following the  humanitarian example of his mother.
    Mr.Mohamud attends William & Mary College in Williamsburg, Virgina.It is a long  way from Somalia.However, that coastal nation is home to many of his  s. His parents  were born there.His mother,Filsan Darman helped start the non-profit agency Aadamiga  Somalia,which provided for aid to Somalia in 1987.
    Filsan Darman said the agency provided food and clothing to Somali people,who had fled  to the Somali capital Mogadishu to escape contradiction in the North.
    Sahnun Mohamud praised his mother's service,"She's been helping Somalia since before I was born."
    Mr.Mohamud became involved in Humanitarian projects early in life.One of his goals     for starting Students for Somalia was to get more non-Somalis to take part in helping Somalia.     He noted that many Somali aid organizations have only Somali members.
    "So my group and my whole motto has been'Let every ethnicity and race help Somalia'.I think it's a huge resource to have non-somali people helping Somalia."said Mohamud.
    This year,Students for Somalia and Aadamiga are cooperating on a project to fight     poverty and increase education.Mr.Mohamud said the groups lend money to women who have     lived a long time in refugee camps in Mogadishu.They use the money to start or     support businesses like small food stores.The women must have a child in school in Somalia to     receive the money.She also must pay back the loan,but Mr.Mohamud says the woman does     not return the loan money to the lender.Instead,she gives it to her child's schoo1.That way,he says,the school can make improvements.
