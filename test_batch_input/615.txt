Mr. Read was born in a small village with high mountains all around it.He has few fields and he can't get enough food for his family.He's often worried about it.So he works harder and harder and tries his best to get more money. 
One afternoon,Mr. Read went out to look for some grass for his cows.It was very hot and he had to have a swim.Suddenly he saw a big tortoise in the water.He swam there and caught it.The next morning he went to the town to sell it in the markets.When he was walking in the street, a car hit him down and he was hurt.He was sent to hospital at once.The doctors looked him over and had an operation on him.Two weeks later he felt much better.The doctors were satisfied with the operation and said,"You'll be fully recovered in a week.We're sure you can write when you leave hospital." 
"It's really a miracle "shouted Mr. Read,"I could neither read nor write before!"
