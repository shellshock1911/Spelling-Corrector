Suppose you don't need your car today.And suppose,as it happens that a stranger in your area does need a car.Would you be willing to rent yours out?
Several carsharing startups,including Getaround,RelayRides and JustSharelt,are eager to connect car owners with renters this way.The companies have different rules,but participating owners receive,generally speaking,about twothirds of the rental earnings.RelayRides says an owner of a midsize,latemodel _ who rents out a car for 10 hours a week could expect to clear about $ 3,000 a year.
Peertopeer carsharing remains in the trial stage;it can be found in San Francisco and a few other places.It has a long way to go before it becomes the auto equivalent of Airbnb,the  surprise success story for peertopeer sharing of space in apartments and houses.
Shelby Clark,founder of RelayRides,says potential investors in his company have been concerned that owners will be afraid to hand their car over to strangers.To address that,he points to Airbnb,saying,"Letting people sleep in your living room is much more of a disturbance into your personal space than letting someone use your car."
All of these companies offer their own insurance coverage for their renters,which are supposed to put owners' minds at ease.But only two states--California and Oregon--have passed  laws to clarify that an owner will not suffer any consequences should a carsharing renter have an accident.
"In all the other states,legal ambiguity remains," Shelby Clark says."If a renter should be involved in a serious accident in those states,the victim can be expected to go after every party possible,including the car's owner."
Also to remove the worries of car owners,the driving records of renters are checked for recent serious violations..
