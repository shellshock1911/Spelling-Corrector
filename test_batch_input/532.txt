Teenagers are more selfish than adults because they use different part of their brain to make decisions, new research suggests. Previous work has shown that when children reach puberty  , there is an increase in connections between nerves in the brain. This occurs particularly in the area involved in decision-making and awareness of other people's feelings, called the "mentalising network".
Now Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a cognitive neuroscientist from the University College London, UK, has used Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging  to scan the brains of 19 adolescents (aged 11 to 17) and 11 adults (aged 21 to 37) while they were asked questions relating to decision-making. Questions such as: "You're going to the cinema, where do you look for film times?"
Blakemore found that unlike adults, teenagers rely on the rear part of the mentalising network to make their decisions, an area of the brain called the superior temporal sulcus. The superior temporal sulcus is involved in processing very basic behavioral actions while the front part, called prefrontal cortex, is involved in more complex functions such as processing how decisions affect others. The prefrontal cortex makes adults more able to understand the consequences of their actions.
In a separate experiment, Blakemore asked 112 participants (aged from 8 to 37) questions and timed how long it took them to respond. Questions such as: "How would your friend feel if she wasn't invited to your party?" She found that the response time got shorter as the participants got older, suggesting that the older people found it easier to put themselves in other people's shoes.
"Teenagers' brains are a work in progress and profoundly different from adults' brains. If you're making decisions about the responsibilities given to teenagers and how to treat teenagers in terms of the law, you need to take this new research into account," said Blakemore.
