Every time I passed boys who were playing basketball, I stopped silently to watch them. I really envied them. But as a girl, I once thought that I could never play basketball.
I like playing basketball though I'm not good at it. I've had a basketball since I was a child. At first, I could play freely because no one cared when I was just a kid. But as I grew up it seemed harder and harder for me to enjoy basketball.
At school, it was always the boys who played basketball during P.E. classes. The girls were only allowed to play volleyball or badminton.
My parents did not let me play basketball at home. "Basketball is not for girls," they said. Even when I went to play basketball with my friends, boys stared at me on the court as if I were an alien.
I was feeling down and had hope of playing basketball. Unexpectedly, something changed the first day of high school. I made some friends who also enjoyed playing basketball. They encouraged me to get back on the court.
One of them told me with a smile, "Go your own way, let others talk." This girl would always play basketball with me. Even the boy who sat next to me in class talked about basketball with me almost every day.
I was inspired by them. Confidence and passion   returned to my heart. I am ready to stand up and play. I will play as well as I can, and for me, even the sky is boundless.
Basketball has become an important part of my life. I am interested in it. I watch and play almost every day. Through basketball, not only do I feel happy and confident, but also learn a lot.
I have heard the NBA star Tracy McGrady say "Nothing is impossible." It is from an advertisement on TV. I have come to realize that life is just like playing basketball. You should have an aim. After that, just be confident and keep going. Never give up and you will _ sooner or later.
I love the motto of the NBA. It can express my strong feelings for basketball, "I love this game!"
