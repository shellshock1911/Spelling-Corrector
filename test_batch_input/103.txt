Lots of people like a good fright at Halloween . Yet, the most frightening thing of all about the night is that twice as many children are killed while out and about on Halloween compared to any other day of the year, according to a study by Safe Kids Worldwide. It can also be a worrying time for others, especially elderly people living alone. But many people think it's just harmless fun.
But is it harmless fun?
Police forces across Britain are giving warnings about Halloween night. They are asking all those wishing to celebrate Halloween this year to respect those who don't want to join in.
Some forces, like West Mercia Police, have produced "Sorry, No Trick or Treat"posters which can be downloaded from their website, and put up in windows. They want people to send them to the old or anyone who may be frightened by ghosts  knocking on their doors.
A spokesman said: "Children should not call on houses where the posters are put up, neither should they call on strangers, as this can put young people at risk and also make some house owners anxious, especially those who are elderly or living alone."
The police want all trick or treaters to remember that disturbing other people or throwing objects at their homes or cars are all criminal offences . "What may start off as a bit of fun could end up with someone getting a criminal record," they warn. "Parents may want to consider having a Halloween party at home, instead."
Kent Police are warning young people never to go into the home of someone they don't know--and to remember not to frighten people.
Warwickshire Police are also warning that tricks may seem like harmless fun but can cause trouble to others. They say behaviour such as throwing eggs can quickly cross the line between being anti-social and causing criminal damage. This can result in fines of PS2,500 for small offences.
