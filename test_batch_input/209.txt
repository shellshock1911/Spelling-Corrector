I am an email user. When I first started to use the email system, I used to read all my email. I didn't have much mail. I gave my friends my email address. Soon I had more mail than I wanted. Some of the mail was junk mail. I was worried. I didn't want my mail to control me.
I've tried some methods to help me get control of my mail. First, I check my mail at the same time every day. Also I try to allow myself only 15~20 minutes every day to process my email. This doesn't always work, but I try. Sometimes I save the messages. Sometimes I just read them, maybe answer a few, and then delete  them.
Sometimes I'm not at all interested in a message, so I don't even open it. I delete it right away. This is very much the way I go through the mail that the postal service delivers to my home.
These methods are very simple. I have some friends who are very clever with computers. From time to time, _ teach me new tricks for managing my email. I'm still amazed at what email can do for me! I'm still worried, however, about having too much to read.
