More women are graduating from colleges than men.The situation is causing some people to worry about the future.The trend could cause social problems,according to a report on July 8 by the Washington Post.
Women received about 57 percent of the bachelor's degrees awarded this year from colleges and universities in the United States.The figure of 57 percent has been the highest since World War II ended in 1945.During the war,many men were in the military.
The gap between men and women is greater among African Americans and Hispanics.Two AfricanAmerican women receive a degree for every AfricanAmerican man.Only 40 percent of Hispanics who get a degree are males.
The USA Department of Education estimates 698,000 females received bachelor's degree this year.The number of male graduates was 529,000.The trend toward more female graduates began in the mid1980s.Nobody seems to know why.However,many theories exist.
Researchers say the trend could lead to social problems.They also say this may indicate two things.It may reflect the increasing success of women.But it also may show the educational problems affecting men.
High school graduation rates are slightly lower for men than for women.Males also make up the vast majority of students in special education classes.
The Business Roundtable is studying the trend.The group is an organization of chief executives of some of the nation's largest corporations.Susan Traiman is the director of the group's education policy.Traiman said the nation couldn't afford to let half its population fail to develop skills needed for the future.
