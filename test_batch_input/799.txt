Young people can have problems with their minds. Some students become worried because they have to study very hard. Others have trouble getting on well with people like their parents and classmates.
Li Wen, a student from No.2 High School, could not follow his teachers in class and, therefore, was doing badly in his lessons. He was in such low spirits for a long time that he started to cut his finger with a knife.
Another student, 16-year-old Yang Fang from No.1 High School, was afraid of exams. Even though she was well prepared for an exam, when she looked at the exam paper, she couldn't think of anything to write.
A recent survey from Jiefang Daily says about 18% of Shanghai teenagers have mental problems. Their troubles include being anxious and very unhappy, and having problems in learning and getting on with people.
Liang Yuezhu, an expert on teenagers from Beijing Friendship Hospital has the following advice for teenagers:
Talk to your parents or teachers often.
Take part in group activities and play sports.
Go to see a doctor if you feel unhappy or unwell.
