Eyesight problems are common among all ages and if they are left untreated, they can cause serious headaches or other problems. The good news is that most eyesight problems can easily be sorted out by wearing glasses.
Regular eye tests are important for everyone. Children and teenagers, under the age of 16 and up to the age of 19 for those full-time education, have the right to have eye tests for free in Britain. As the eye test is free, there's no excuse for not having a regular eye test. Doctors suggest that it's better to have an eye test about once a year.
Wearing glasses isn't always regarded as all that cool and teens who suddenly need to wear glasses may find it difficult to accept. If they've grown up wearing glasses, then they may be more used to it. However, if your eyes are in poor health, not wearing glasses can put even more pressure on your eyes and could make them even worse.
Thankfully, the days of little choice of glasses frames   for teenagers are gone and there's now a wide selection of frames. If a teen does need to wear glasses, then it's good to let him or her choose the type, as he or she will be able to choose something he or she feels comfortable. Don't forget to be guided by the experts on glasses too.
