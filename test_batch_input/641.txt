I stood at the wqindow and watched the neighborhood children flying their kites on the hill behind our house. Next to me, my four-year-old son, Michael, pressed his face against the glass. Then, looking up at me with pleading eyes, he again asked if he could have a kite.
   Ever since he had first seen the children on the hill, Michael had been asking the same question, and had been given the same answer: "Wait till you are a little older." Michael hid his face in my skirt, something he always did when he was going to cry and didn't want me to see.
   I felt like crying myself. Because of my health I simply didn't have the strength or energy to fly a kite with Michael, and Michael was too young to fly a kite all by himself. My husband worked long, irregular  hours, and even so we kept going deeper in debt. As a result, a tension had grown between us.
   Michael was the one spark of life left for me. As I put him into bed that evening, he said, "Mummy, may I pray to God to send me a yellow kite?"
   "Yes," I said. "We will leave it up to him." I was tired of the whole thing and hoped that maybe this would make Michae stop talking about it. 
   The next morning I raised the shade in the kitchen, and stared at the sight that met my eyes--a string hanging down in front of the window. I ran out of the back door. There was a kite, a yellow one.
   Michael clapped his hands and jumped up and down. "Mummy, I knew God would answer my prayer!" I didn't believed. We asked all over the neighborhood but twe never found the kite's former owner.
   My depression left me, and as my health improved, so did my relationship with my husband. All I needed was comfort; no matter what it is, the kindness always exists in my heart.
