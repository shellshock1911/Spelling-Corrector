Twenty-three senior high school graduates of 1999 from Wuhan, Hubei Province, have recently left for Germany on a work-study program according to Xi'an Evening Newspaper.
They will study hotel management in Bavarian Hotel Management School for a year and then take up two-year practice in Germany. Upon graduation, they will also get diplomas   recognized internationally. During their two-year practice, they earn no less than 1 200 Deutsche Marks   a month.
The program, organized by a company in Wuhan, aims at providing the city's high school graduates with new job chances.
Applicants   must first pass an exam given by the German side and pay 180 000 yuan covering the three year's study and living expenses in Germany. In spite of this, the program still attracted a lot of high school graduates and their parents. And applicants came in a continuous stream.
"The change for my child to go to college is small. What's more, it's not easy to find a job. We find the work-study program an equally good way out for him," a parent said, "We don't worry much about the high costs because the total income from the two-year-long practice will be quite enough to clear them."
