If you go into the woods with your friends,stay with them. If you don't,you may get lost. If you do get lost,this is what you should do.
    Sit down and stay where you are. Don't try to find your friend--let them find you. There is another way to help your friend or other nearby people to find you. Give them a signal by shouting or whistling three times. Stop shouting and whistling. Then three times again. Any signal given three times is a call for help. Keep up shouting or whistling,always three times together. When people hear you,they will know that you are not just making noise for fun. They will let you know that they have heard your signal. They will give two shouts, two whistles or two gun shots. When a signal is given twice, it is an answer to a call for help.
    If you don't think that you will get help, try to make a little house--cover up the holes with branches with lots of leaves,and a soft bed with leaves and grass.
   What should you do if you need drinking water? You would have to leave your little branch house to look for a river. Don't just walk away. Pick off small branches and drop as you walk so that you can find your way back.
    The most important thing to do when you are lost is to stay one place.
