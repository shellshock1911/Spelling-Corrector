If you live in a city where everyone rushes, realize that you don't have to be like everyone else.You can be different.
I can't give you a step-by-step guide to moving slower, but here are some things to consider and perhaps adopt, if they work for your life.
1.Do less
Cut back on your projects, on your task list, on how much you try to do each day.Focus not on quantity but on quality.Pick 2 or 3 important things-or even just one important thing- and work on those first.
2.Have fewer meetings
Meetings are usually a big waste of time and make you rush.Try to have blocks of time with no interruptions, so you don't have to rush from one meeting to another.
3.Give yourself time to get ready and get there
If you're constantly rushing to appointments or other places you have to be, it's because you don't allot  enough time in your schedule for preparing and for traveling.Pad your schedule to allow time for this stuff.If you think it only takes you 10 minutes to get ready for work or a date, perhaps give yourself 30 to 45 minutes so you don't have to shave in a rush or put on makeup in the car.
4.Practice being comfortable with sitting doing nothing
When people have to wait, they become impatient or uncomfortable.Try standing in a line and just watching and listening w people around you.It takes practice, but after a while, you'll do it with a smile.
5.Realize that if it doesn't get done, that's Ok.
There's always tomorrow.And yes, I know that's a frustrating attitude for some of you who don't like laziness or living without firm deadlines, but it's also reality.The world likely won't end if you don't get that task done today.Your boss might get mad, but the company won't _ and the life will inevitably go on.
Try these things out.Life is better when unrushed.
Remember the quote: If nature can get everything done without rushing, so can you.
