Dear editor,
Under China's current   educational system, there are those who do nothing but study. They of course are thought to be model students.
But I feel that there is another type of student who, perhaps not as diligent   as the first type, uses his time more efficiently and achieves a lot academically.
Last year, a classmate of mine was accepted by a top university. It surprised all of us. It was because, unlike most of us, he didn't spend too much of his time studying.
When I asked him the secret of his success, he said that the key was properly and scientifically arranging his time.
" I spent a lot of time keeping fit and as a result, I was able to better concentrate   on my class work."
The moral   of the story is: it isn't necessary to sit at your desk all day long to get high academic   grades.
Yours,
Zhang Zishu
