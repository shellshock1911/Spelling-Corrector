Four out of ten parents in the UK spend between PS100 and PS500 on their children's birthday parties, according to a survey. Four in ten parents of children under 18, who were questioned in a survey, admitted that they felt pressured into organizing more expensive birthday parties for their children than they would like to.
How much parents spend on their children's birthday parties is one of the most frequently discussed topics on parenting websites. Here is one comment on Mumsnet summing up the thoughts of many parents: "Where we live everyone hires places, entertainers and so on. I don't want to compare with my rich neighbors, but I want my son to have what all his classmates have."
The research was carried out on behalf of the children's charity, Lumos, set up by the author JK Rowling. Just 13 percent of parents spent PS50 or less in the past year on their children's parties.
Many children's clowns  or entertainers charge PS150 or more for an hour, and parents often feel it necessary to book a special place. Even without these, the cost of plates, the cake and party bags can _ . Party Pieces, a company set up by Carole and Michael Middleton, charge about PS16 for a birthday cake for a party with 16 guests, PS22 for table decorations and up to PS48 for party bags.
Many children of famous people have increasingly expensive parties, often seen in famous magazines. Suri Cruise, the daughter of actor Tom Cruise and actress Katie Holmes, enjoyed a PS100,000 birthday party according to a report.
Georgette Mulheir of Lumos, said,"Parents in the UK are under increasing pressure to spend more and more money on birthday parties for their children and their children's friends."
