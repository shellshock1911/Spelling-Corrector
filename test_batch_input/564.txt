Being a victim of schoolyard violence can help pupils learn how to manage argument and develop their ability to get along with others, it was claimed.
Helene Guldberg, associate lecturer in child development at the Open University, said trying to stop the "supposedly terrible dangers of bullying " can do more harm than good. She insisted teachers should not break up "everyday playground argument", saying children should be left to deal with it themselves.
In an on-line article, Dr. Guldberg said that bullying was "an experience that children need to develop". But the comments were strongly criticized by anti-bullying campaigners.
According to official figures, almost half of children claim they are bullied at school. One of the biggest studies of its kind by Ofsted showed 48 percent of young people had been orally or physically  _ in the last year. It comes despite a number of government measures designed to crack down on the threats.
Writing on a website, Dr. Guldberg said: "Teachers are increasingly taking the task of looking after children's health and well-being rather than being allowed to get on with the task of educating them. Children are encouraged to assume their relationships with other children are damaging, and encouraged to look upon their classmates with suspicion." She added: "If we treat children as if they cannot possibly cope with hurtful experiences, then we will likely to weaken their confidence and make them less likely to cope with difficult events in the future. In effect, we will prevent them from growing up."
The comments echo  remarks made by teachers in recent years who claim the education system has been too focused on developing children's social skills at the expense of academic learning. But Sue Steel, national manager of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said: "Children who are being bullied often find it difficult to tell anyone. Teachers can help by giving appropriate attention."
