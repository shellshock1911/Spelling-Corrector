It is known to us that computer users are being warned by industry experts to pay attention to secret codes which could be used to record their conversation.
E-mails, screen savers, and electronic greeting cards can carry a secret code which is able to turn on the computer's microphone, make a recording, and forward it to someone else without the user's knowledge.
In fact any attachments   sent to a computer, whether it is a game of Space Invaders, or a moving picture, can possibly be used to spy  .
Experts say people should always think twice about opening attachments because --- although not common --- bugging   by computer can and has been done.
Bill Lyons, head of the Internet Security Company Finjan, said, "People in the army have tested this and you can be sure, if people in general are aware of it, then computer hackers   are aware of it. The frightening thing is that there are tools on the Internet which people, using a simple search method, can find, and which will enable them to attach this dangerous code to simple attachments."
