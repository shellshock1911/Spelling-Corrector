The World Health Organization says obesity rates are rising in Pacific island countries. So, too, are health problems linked to being overweight.
The WHO says a major reason for the rising obesity rates is an increase in imported foods. It says many Pacific islanders have replaced their traditional diets of vegetables and fruits with imported processed foods.
Dr.Temu Waqanivalu is with the World Health Organization's South Pacific office in Suva, Fiji.He says many of the imported products lack nutritional value.
Temu Waqanivalu said: "In some of the places, you'd be amazed to see how a bottle of Coke is cheaper than a bottle of water. I think that represents the kind of offenvironment we've created that doesn't really encourage or make lifestyle choices an easy choice for the population."
And a lack of physical activity among many Pacific islanders only adds to the obesity problem.
The WHO says more than 50 percent of the population is overweight in at least ten Pacific island countries. The rate is as high as 80 percent among women in the territory of American Samoa. Fiji had the lowest obesity rate at 30 percent.
In all, almost ten million people live in Pacific island countries. The WHO estimates that about 40 percent of them have health disorders related to diet and nutrition.
Diabetes rates are among the highest in the world. Forty-seven percent of the people in American Samoa have diabetes. So do 44 percent of the people in Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand.
By comparison, the diabetes rate is 13 percent in the United States, a country that has its own problems with rising obesity.
Officials also note an increase in nutritional problems like anemia and not enough vitamin A in the diets of Pacific islanders. Dr. Waqanivalu says treating conditions related to obesity and diet puts pressure on limited health resources and budgets.
