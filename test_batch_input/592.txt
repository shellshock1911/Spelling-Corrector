World's Largest Ball of Paint
Alexandria, Ind.
In 1977, Michael Carmichael set out to create the biggest ball of paint anywhere. Starting with a baseball as center, he painted layer after layer of paint day after day, year after year. The ball weighs more than 1,300 pounds, with more than 20,000 coats of paint, which is recognized by Guinness World Records. Visitors can paint the ball themselves and become part of history.
The Museum of Dirt
Boston, Mass.
The museum is the idea of Glenn Johnson. Labeled   glass bottles contain such treasures as dirt from the Great Wall of China, as well as sand from a desert in Saudi Arabia and Omaha Beach in France. Best of all, the cost of seeing this museum is dirt cheap: It's free.

Paper House
Rockport, Mass.
Swedish immigrant   Ellis Stenman was much ahead of his time in 1922, when he started to build a two-room house almost entirely out of newspaper. At the time, people didn't give much, if any, thought to recycling paper. In fact, "recycling" wasn't even a word yet. The house is framed with wood, but the walls are made of 215 layers of newspaper. In all, he used about 100,000 newspapers. ks5u
