Before l tell you bow many hours a day people spend ,watching content on tablets ,TVs,phones ,and so forth, let's talk quick about technology .The word ,l mean , according to my dictionary's primary definition, means  "the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes."
These days, you say that word and  I'd refer to most magic images of tablets ,smart phones, digital cameras ,satellites, cruise missiles ,electric cars or glasses-free 3D handhelds. That's all correct ,of course--that stuff's definitely technology ,I mean But so is a wheel, or a pencil ,or if we're going all the way back, it's any tool, including something as simple as a stick snatched up and applied to some purpose ,say ,knocking something down for dinner or turning over a rock to get whatever's underneath.
The reason I raise the point is that the following poll  implies that something different is happening when we pick up an electronic tablet instead of pencil and paper to compose an email, or an e-reader instead of a book to read something like the digital version of a magazine, or a novel by Stephen King Those who view changes as bad ,or at least a little bit terrifying , may look at the numbers below and read ominous  signs.
But okay, hold that thought ,and let's jump to the poll results.
The poll was conducted by Poll Position to determine "how many hours a day do you spend looking at either a TV, computer screen ,e-reader, PDA or cell phone? "The group asked that question of I,220 registered voters, by phone ,on November 19, 2011. Its generalized finding 60% of Americans spend between one and six hours a day viewing content on electronic devices.
A bout a third spend one to three hours , another third spend four to six ,and the remaining third spend between seven and more than 10 hours a day viewing content on electronic devices, Supposing most of us spend between 12 and 18hours per 24-hour day awake ,that's a pretty high range of use, from one hour through 10 or more.
