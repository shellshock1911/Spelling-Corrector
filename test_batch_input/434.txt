Beijing is pulling out all stops to make sure that leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting on Nov7 to 8 get a taste and feel of China's rich culture. Here's what you need to know about Beijing's preparations for the summit: Huairou, has been given a major makeover in the past year since its Yanqi Lake was picked to host the APEC summit.
The once-quiet place in mountains, which is about 50 km from Beijing's city center, now has a surprising convention center built in traditional Chinese architectural  style and a 21-storey scallop-shaped  hotel.
Costumes
Traditional Chinese-style jackets, or tangzhuang, have been designed for the more than 20 leaders who attend the summit, in keeping with APEC tradition.
Dishes
A menu including dishes from Beijing and other parts of China is waiting to be served. The menu even includes simple food that is popular with the locals, such as spring rolls, pork dumplings and tanghulu, said the People's Daily.
Security
Some 1000 surveillance cameras have been set in Beijing's Huairou district to keep safe, where the meetings will be held.
Pollution control
To ensure blue skies for the APEC meetings, Beijing made a traffic control system that allows cars to be used in turn, based on whether the licence plate numbers are odd or even.
The system took effect on Monday (Nov3,2014) and will last until the next Wednesday (Nov 12,2014). It aims to cut total traffic by 35 percent.
