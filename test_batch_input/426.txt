Letter One
                                                                                      21 July, 2008
Dear Sirs,
Our foreman, Mr. Li Ming, had an accident on July 6, 2008. He crushed his forefinger when operating a machine. At that time, we didn't think the accident was serious enough to report, but Mr. Li has returned to his work after an absence of two weeks and is still unable to carry on his normal duties. We therefore wish to make a claim   under the above policy   and shall appreciate your sending us the necessary claim form.
                                                                             Yours faithfully,
                                                                           (Signature) 
Letter Two
27 July, 2008
Dear Sirs,
     We have received your letter of July 21 and noted that you made a claim for the accident of Mr. Li Ming. We would, however, remind you of the terms of the policy that this claim should have been submitted within three days after the accident. More than two weeks have now passed. Consequently, your claim to compensation under the policy has been forfeited (, ).
Nevertheless, as an exceptional measure, we have decided to overlook its late submission, though we are bound to say that it should have been clear from Mr. Li's absence from work that this accident was more serious than you had supposed and that there seems to be no good reason why this claim should not have been made earlier.
We are enclosing   a claim form as requested, but must emphasize that future claims cannot be entertained if you cannot comply with the terms of the policy.
                                                                                 Yours faithfully,
                                                                            (Signature)
