I am a music store owner. One day, when I was cleaning the instruments in my store, I saw an old man come in. His short steps dragged on the carpet. "Is 77 too old to learn the banjo  ?" he asked.
"You can learn to play it well," I replied, holding back my doubts. My mind told me I was giving false encouragement. I reached the instructor's schedule and gave the rates, the available time and the additional information that he would need. To my surprise and delight, the old man, Carl, began banjo lessons three days later with my most patient teacher.
With nothing to do at home but practice, Carl made surprising progress. After breakfast he practiced for his required half hour. While waiting for lunch he picked up his banjo again for just a couple of minutes. Since TV was difficult for him to see and hear, he often played the banjo in the evenings. Carl was always early for lessons so it was a surprise that he didn't arrive one Tuesday.
The next morning I listened to the answering machine with sadness. "Carl's in hospital," the voice recorded.
Two months later, I shared the newspaper _ with the banjo teacher. We both shed tears for a surprisingly clever banjo student.
Several months later, a woman came into the store carrying a plant. "This is for Carl's banjo teacher," she said. "I'm his wife, Mary."
"Why did Carl want to play the banjo?" I asked. Mary took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "Carl was at some show when he was 10 years old. He came close to the stage to watch the performers. When they were packing up their instruments, the banjo player said to Carl, 'You want to see this up close?' Carl climbed up on the stage and from then on he wanted to play the banjo." Carl had waited 67 years to realize a dream! Mary gave the plant to Carl's banjo teacher. "Thank you for the best six months of his life," she said.
