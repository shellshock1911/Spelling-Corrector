One cold, rainy night in 1979, staying on the deck of the nuclear attack submarine  USS Birmingham entering Hampton Roads Harbor, a soldier who was called Jeff Harris was suddenly hit by a huge wave that took away his ship's ball cap.
Months later, while walking along Chesapeake Boulevard beach in Hampton, Will Miller, a Vietnam veteran  and Navy  commander, happened to find Harris' cap which was half-buried in the sand then. Knowing how important a ship's cap was to its owner, Miller saved the hat, hoping one day to find its owner. The cap was packed away for years but recently appeared again at Miller's home in Florida.
"It suddenly fell out of a box onto my computer keyboard, right in front of me," said Miller. "I guessed it was telling me, 'It's time to get me home.'"
An extensive Internet search led Miller to a USS Birmingham website and finally to Harris. The two sent e-mails back and forth, and one night Miller's phone rang.
"This is Jeff Harris," the voice on the phone said. "You have my hat!"
The two sailors talked for almost half an hour, telling sea stories to each other and thinking of the common relationship between seamen."
"Most non-seagoing people wouldn't understand how much a sailor likes his hat," Miller said. "Your hat protects you from sun, wind, salt and cold, and when you lose it, especially one with your ship's name on it, it's a big thing. I'm delighted to get it back to Jeff."
