The Pew report---which was based on surveys carried out in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland and the Czech Republic --- concluded that the European Union was " the new sick man of Europe".
The percentage of Europeans with a favorable view of the EU has plunged from 60 percent last year to 45 percent now.
The UK may be considered the most Eurosceptic country, but its support for the union has barely changed in the past 12 months, slipping only two points to 43 percent.
By contrast, France's backing for the EU has slipped sharply, from 60 percent last year to 41 percent today.
On the question of whether to remain in the EU, 46 percent of the British want to leave the union and surprisingly, the same percentage went to stay.
The Pew report's authors said, "The long-drawn economic crisis has created bad forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and Germans from everyone else."
They added, "The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the main disaster of the euro crisis. The European project now stands in a bad reputation across much of Europe."
The only European leader rated highly by their own voters was the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with 74 percent voters in favor of her.
Prime Minister David Cameron was the next highest with a positive score of 37 percent among the British public, although he can take some comfort from the fact that 58 percent of Poles and half of all French people think he is doing a good job.
In spite of the dark economic future and growing doubt of the EU, there were strong majorities of more than 60 percent in favor of keeping the euro in the five countries surveyed that use the single currency.
