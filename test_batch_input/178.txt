In a mango orchard   outside a village there lived a mischievous   monkey. He kept on eating the ripe mangoes. The orchard keeper tried to trap the monkey. But every time, the monkey escaped from the trap.
One day, the monkey walked about and went into the nearby town. "The town people are so busy. It is so crowded here," the monkey thought. Soon, the monkey was _ and running away with food. By evening, he had made life quite different for the town people. "The town is more fun than the orchard. I will stay here," he thought. Days went by, and the monkey was considered by the town people as something very frightening. "Here he comes again!" they screamed when they saw the monkey.
One day, a juggler   came to the town. The people of the town went to him. "We want you to help us get rid of the monkey," they said to the juggler. The juggler said in return, "Do not worry. Get me some jars   with narrow necks." When the jars were brought to him, he put some peanuts into them and placed them out of a field. The monkey became curious when he saw the peanuts. "Yummy! Let me quickly get the peanuts and run," he thought. He put his hand inside a jar and grabbed a big handful of peanuts. But he could not pull out of his clenched fist  , as the neck of the jar was so narrow. If the monkey had dropped some of the peanuts back into the jar, he could have pulled his hand out. But he was greedy. So he didn't drop any of the peanuts. The town people trapped the monkey with his hand inside the jar. They got hold of a rope and tied him to a post. Then the monkey was sold to a zoo. That was the end of the greedy monkey.
