Asian athletes have had a spare time in the first two days of the World Indoor Championships in Birmingham, England. But Chinese hurdler  Liu Xiang surprised everyone by taking the bronze medal in the men's 60-meter hurdles.
Liu became the first Chinese male athlete to get a world indoor medal in the 18-year history of the championship and was the only Asian medallist this time.
"Karaoke (OK)! That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to get a big group of my friends together and sing. I love both Western and Chinese music but especially Michael Jackson," said Liu after clocking 7.52 seconds in the final to take his place on the podium  .
"Frankly speaking, _ " Liu said. "On my arrival here, my aim was just to fight my way into the final. After I did that, I thought I might just get into the top six. I knew British hurdler Colin Jackson was going to be here and he's the world record holder indoors and out."
"There was also Cuba's reigning   Olympic champion Anier Garcia and Allen Johnson, from the United States." It was Johnson, the reigning world outdoor champion, who was successful in 7.47 seconds with Garcia second and Jackson finished back in fifth.
Now Liu will never underestimate his chances again and is aiming for glory in Paris later this year.
"There is the World Championship outdoors in the summer and I have now got to think that I can get a medal. I can never again think that I can't get a medal," he said. Liu's success here marks his rapid transition into the senior ranks.
"The university gives me a lot of flexibility. My courses are very easy and the teachers are very helpful," said Liu.
They might have to be even more accommodating  now if Liu starts taking on celebrity status, although an invite to his homecoming karaoke party may help.
