Why do we call the sounds of birds, whales and insects songs? Because something about what we hear seems to have beauty, and some mellifluous   structure that touches us more than any possible message. Though for many years science has cautioned against hearing too much of what we humans would like to hear when we are trying to understand animal sounds, the musicality in some sounds is now starting to have an effect on the science of animal communication itself.
Many specific animal sounds express aggression , warning, or food, but such practical explanations are tough to apply to the long songs. Some whale songs can go on for up to 24 hours. The usual explanation for birdsong is that the birds are singing to attract mates or to announce the limits of their area. But the audience is not always evident for these long love songs, which have many of the elements related to human music: rhythm, melody  , themes, repeating patterns, organization, variety, interest -- all adding up to something humans have found beautiful for thousands of years. "Birds taught man," wrote Roman poet and philosopher   Lucretius, "and taught them songs before their art began."
What is the scientific value of such sounds? The advantage of hearing music in nature and trying to reach out to nature through music is that though we don't fully understand it, it is so accessible.
Music refuses explanation, but it clearly expresses something deep and important, which humans can't live without. Finding music in the sound of birds, whales and other animals makes the farther frontiers  of nature see much closer to us.
