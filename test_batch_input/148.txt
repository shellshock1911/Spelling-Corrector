It's official, not making your bed keeps you healthy. Dust mites   present in everyone's home can cause asthma, but they can not live in the dry conditions of an unmade bed.
The average bed is home to one and a half million mites, and they cause a number of common allergies  , as they chomp away on human skin in the night; and then produce the allergens which we inhale  .
Dust mites grow in the warm humid conditions prevalent in the occupied bed, but they cannot multiply without moisture. So leaving the bed unmade during the day means that the water is not retained by the sheets, which means that the mites dehydrate   and die.
Researcher Dr. Stephen Pretlove who has developed a computer model to track how changes in the home can reduce a numbers of dust mites said, "We know that mites can only survive by taking in water from the atmosphere using small glands on the outside of their body."
In the next stage of their research, the scientists are putting mite pockets into beds in 36 houses around the United Kingdom. This will test the _ of the computer model and will investigate how people's daily routines affect mite populations.
Building features such as heating ventilation   and insulation   will also be adjustable to monitor how the mites cope and react to different atmospheres.
Dr. Pretlove said the research had potential to reduce the PS700 million spent treating mite-induced illnesses each year in the UK.
"Our findings could help building designers create healthy homes and health care workers point out environments most at risk from mites."
Dr. Matt Hallsworth, of the charity Asthma UK, said, "House-dust mite allergen can be an important trigger for many people with asthma, but at present many people find they are inevitable."
