One of the most common complaints of people living in the city is annoying neighbors. Here are some ways to handle noisy neighbors. 
Accept Some Degree of Apartment Noise
Before getting worked up over the noisy neighbors in the apartment, make sure to have 
realistic expectations. Everyone living in an apartment building is bound to hear noise from other units' televisions, music, and children occasionally.   
Understand Noisy Neighbors from their point of view
It's probably the case that the neighbor who is driving everyone crazy doesn't realize how 
far his noise is carrying. Remember that noise level is difficult to control with children. Babies 
unavoidably cry in the middle of the night. 
Meet the Neighbors and Be Friendly 
Making a friendly gesture will surprisingly reduce apartment noise. Neighbors who know
 each other will probably be much more careful not to bother each other.  
 Address Noise Calmly and Face-to-Face 
 If a loud noise needs to be addressed, go to the offending apartment personally and knock politely on the door. Being polite will usually bring a polite 
response 
Report Noisy Neighbors to the Landlord 
If a noise issue becomes a constant problem or doesn't improve after a personal request,
 it's time to bring it up to management. Make sure to be objective and fair in your report, and be 
able to record the frequency of the problem and provide details about it.   
Things to Avoid when Dealing with a Loud Neighbor 
There are some  "don't"s  when it comes to dealing life with a loud apartment 
neighbor. Don't 
*Seek revenge  or try to "outdo" a noisy neighbor 
* Complain to them face to face repeatedly about the same issue 
* Suffer in silence 
Doing these things may work for some time, but they're never good long-term solutions. 
Instead, they will probably only exacerbate the situation.
