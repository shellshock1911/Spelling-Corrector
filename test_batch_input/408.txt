Daily life can be made happier. It is a matter of choice. It is our attitude that makes us feel happy or unhappy. It is true, we meet all kinds of situations during the day, and some of them may not be conductive to happiness. We can choose to refuse to think about the unhappy events. If we let outer events influence our moods, we become their slaves. On the other hand, we can free ourselves from outer influences. We can choose to be happy, and we can do a lot to add happiness to our lives.
What is happiness? It is a feeling of inner peace and satisfaction. It is usually experienced when there are no worries, fears or confused thoughts, and this usually happens when we do something we love to do or when we win, gain or achieve something that we value. It seems to be the outcome of positive events, but it actually comes from the inside, triggered by outer events.
For most people happiness seems passing quickly. One of the best ways to keep it, is by gaining inner peace through daily meditation . As the mind becomes more peaceful, it becomes easier to choose the happiness habit.
