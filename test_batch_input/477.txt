If you win the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot  , you may not be as lucky as you think. Many winners experience the so-called curse of the lottery, with some squandering their fortunes and others meeting tragic ends.
"So many of them wind up unhappy or wind up broke. People have had terrible things happen," said Don McNay, 56, a financial consultant to lottery winners and the author of Life Lessons from the Lottery. "People commit suicide. People run through their money. Easy comes, easy goes. They go through divorce or people die."
"It's just a great change that they're not ready for," McNay told Time on Tuesday. "It's the curse of the lottery because it made their lives worse instead of improving them."
About 70 percent of people who suddenly receive a windfall of cash will lose it within a few years, according to the National Endowment for Financial Education. Here are some of the stories of past winners that gamblers should know about:
Abraham Shakespeare was murdered in 2009 after he won a $30 million lottery jackpot. The 47-year-old Florida man was shot twice in the chest and then buried under a slab of concrete in a backyard, ABC News reported. Dorris "Dee Dee" Moore, who authorities say befriended him after his lottery win, was found guilty of first degree murder in 2012. His brother, Robert Brown, told the BBC that Shakespeare always said he regretted winning the lottery. "'I'd have been better off going broke.' He said that to me all the time," Brown said.
