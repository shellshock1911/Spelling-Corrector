Doctor and Robber
One night about nine o'clock, Dr. Eyck, a surgeon  , had a phone call from Dr. Haydon at the hospital in Clens Falls. The surgeon was asked to go there at once to operate on a very sick boy who shot himself while playing with a gun. The doctor was soon on his way to Clens Falls. It was 60 miles away. And it was snowing heavily in the city. The surgeon thought he could get there before 12 o'clock.A few minutes later, the doctor was stopped by a man in an old black coat. Gun in hand, the man ordered the doctor to get out. Then the man drove the car down the road, leaving the doctor in the falling snow.
It was after two o'clock in the morning when the doctor arrived at the hospital in Clens Falls.Dr. Haydon told him that the boy had died an hour before.The two doctors walked by the door of the hospital waiting room. There sat the man in the old black coat with his head in his hands.
"MR. Cunningham," said Dr. Haydon to the man, "This is Dr. Eyck. He is the surgeon who came all the way from Albany to save your boy."
