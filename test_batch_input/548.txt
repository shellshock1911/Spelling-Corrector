Tiger Mom, ks5u
       You've been criticized  a lot since you published your memoir , Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. One problem is that some people don't get your humor. They think you're serious about all things, and they think Lulu and I are oppressed  by our ill mother. That is not true.
       But for real, it's not their fault. No outsider can know what our family is really like. They don't hear us laughing over each other's jokes. They don't see us eating our hamburgers with fried rice. They don't know how much fun we have when the six of us -- dogs included -- squeeze into one bed and argue about what movies to download from Netflix.
       I admit: Having you as a mother was no tea party. There were some play dates I wish I'd gone to and some piano camps I wish I'd skipped. But now that I'm 18 and about to leave the tiger den , I'm glad you and Daddy raised me the way you did. 
       A lot of people have accused you of producing robot kids who can't think for themselves. Well, that's funny. I think your strict parenting forced me to be more independent. Early on, I decided to be an easy child to raise. Maybe I got it from Daddy -- he taught me not to care what people think and to make my own choices -- but I also decided to be who I want to be. 
       Everybody's talking about the birthday cards we once made for you, which you rejected because they weren't good enough. Funny how some people are convinced that Lulu and I are scarred for life. Maybe if I had poured my heart into it, I would have been upset. But let's face it: It took me 30 second; I didn't even sharpen the pencil. That's why, when you rejected it, I didn't feel you were rejecting me. If I actually tried my best at something, you'd never throw it back in my face.
       ...And for that, Tiger Mom, thank you.
                                                         Yours,
