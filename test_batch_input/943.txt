Due to the increasing number of violence acts produced in schools all over the world,more and more parents prefer to have their children educated at home rather than at school. This way they can assure their safety and well-being,although teachers and school representatives are trying to improve the situation in schools by increasing the number of the persons in charge with the safety of the students.
The main reason for violence acts are the films and cartoons that fill the children's time.They want to do everything.they watch on TV and never think at the consequences,and they may hurt a classmate or a teacher.
On the other hand, parents are not fully satisfied with the children's results obtained in classes and they consider private classes would have better results.
When a teacher has to watch 30 students in class he can't probably see what each of them is doing,how he is writing,or if he understands the explanations.At home the teacher can explain in details everything the child doesn't understand as many times as he considers proper.
And many times.the child grows fond of the teacher at home,who becomes his best friend,and who helps him whenever he needs someone to talk to.
However, the best solution would be a mixture between the education received at school and that at home,because school makes children communicate and socialize.Keeping a child at home for fear there might happen something bad to him.only makes the child's character weak and prevents him from knowing what real life is.Staying in _ only does harm to the child.
All in all.schools have been created to help children,not to harm them,so it's best to keep children in these special places,where they learn,laugh,have fun and make new friends.
