Yousuf Karsh,the Canadian portrait artist who photographed many of the most influential figures of the 20thcentury,died in a Boston hospital on July l3 th,2002.He was 93.
Working from a studio in Ottawa,Karsh produced famous portraits of such subjects as Winston Churchill,John F.Kennedy,Ernest Hemingway and Albert Einstein.Actually he has become almost as famous as his legendary subjects.In the latest edition of Who's Who,which listed the most notable people of the last century,Karsh was the only Canadian of the 100 famous people listed----51 0f whom Karsh had photographed.
As a master portraitist,often working in black and white.Karsh was famous for talking to his subjects as he was getting the shot's composition just right,asking them questions and putting them at ease.In preparation,he read as much as he could about the _ ,but avoided having the idea beforehand of how he would photograph them.He sought, as he wrote in Karsh Portfolio in 1967,to capture the "essential element which has made them great," explaining,"All I know is that within every mall a secret is hidden,and as a photographer, it is my task to reveal it if I can."
Karsh was born in America in 1908,and his uncle,George Nakash,brought him to John Garo,all outstanding photographer,to teach him in 1928.Four years later,Karsh set up his own studio in Ottawa.
In December of 1941,his memorable portrait of Winston Churchill brought Karsh into international fame.Canada's Prime Minister Mackenzie King arranged for him to photograph Churchill following Churchill's speech in the House of Commons.Not told,Churchill lit up a cigar, "Why was I not told of this?'' Karsh asked him to remove the cigar and,when he didn't,stepped forward and gently removed it with the comment,"Forgive me,Sir."Churchill glowered   as the shot was taken,then permitted Karsh to take still another,;jokingly commenting,"You can even make a roaring lion stand still to be photographed." The Churchill portrait has since appeared in publications all over the world.
Karsh traveled to London in 1943 with his portable studio ---- an 8-by-10 view camera and many studio lamps to photograph such notables as George Bernard Shaw and the royal family.All these portraits fully illustrate Karsh's ability.
