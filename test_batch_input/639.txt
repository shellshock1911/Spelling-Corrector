Do you suffer from perfectionism ?
According to psychologist and perfectionism researcher, Hamaehek D.E.there are two types of perfectionism: normal and neurotic  .A person with normal or healthy perfectionism feels a deep sense of pleasure from the dull effort of working towards "perfect". And then there are the neurotic or unhealthy perfectionists who never feel satisfied but keep struggling towards impossible goals.These people often measure their own self-worth entirely in terms of productivity and accomplishment.
It is necessary to notice if you are struggling and feel tense while trying to perfect your recipe, article, parenting, job, project, etc.You are fighting and resisting your own humanness.
How do you know if you suffer from perfectionism?

* Do you get impatient with others when they make a mistake?
* If you fail an assignment at work or school, do you feel like a failure?

Your relationship with yourself is the foundation for all of your other relationships.If you are hard on yourself, then you'll in turn be hard on others.If we are unable to care for our innermost beings, then our lives will reflect this fault in some way.Embracing  your own humanness is the doorway to seeing the miracles of who you are at your best.
Dr. Bemie Siegcl writes in his new book on miracles, "Our body loves us, but it needs to know we love our lives in order for it to do all it can to help us survive.The change in body energy motivated by the love leads to chemical changes in our body and makes a difference.
In many cases, this kind of miracle needs hard work.But when you are willing to do the work, and live in your heart, it can happen."
