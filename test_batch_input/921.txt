How Good Are US Drivers?
The CBS-TV"National Drivers' Test",showed that many US drivers have a lot to learn.Here's why.
CBS picked 1799 sample drivers to take the test in TV studios in New York,Philadelphia,Chicago,and Los Angeles.More than two out of five of the drivers failed the test.And the average score was the lowest passing mark--51 points out of a possible 80.
Chicago drivers did best with an average of 53 points.Los Angeles drivers came next with 52 points.New York and Philadelphia drivers got 50 points--a failing score.Drivers with 50 points or less were rated"poorly informed"by the judges.
Here are some of the test results:
1.Are men drivers better informed than women ones?
Yes.Men averaged 52 points.Women got an average of 49.
2.Are older drivers better informed than younger drivers?
No.Drivers under 26 averaged 52 points.Drivers from 27 to 45 averaged 51.Drives over 45 failed with a 48-point average.
3.Does education make a difference?
Yes.College graduates averaged 52 points.High school graduates averaged 50.Those without high school diplomas  got 48.And people who had taken driver education courses scored an average of 53 points--three more than those who hadn't.
4.Does driving experience make a difference?
Yes.Drivers with three or more years of experience averaged 51 points.Drivers with less experience averaged 49.
Here are some surprising facts brought out by the test:
1.More than one out of three drivers did not know that a blinking red light means a full stop.
2.Three out of ten drivers did not know that an octagonal(eight-sided)sign means stop.
3.More than two out of three drivers did not know what to do when being"tailgated ".
The answer:slow down,drive to the right,and let the driver behind pass.
The results of the test were turned over to the National Safety Council .They will help future safety planning.
