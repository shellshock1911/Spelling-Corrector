A Charlotte, NC, lawyer bought a box of very rare and expensive cigars, and then insured them against fire among other things.Having smoked his entire great cigars within a month, the lawyer filed claim   against the insurance company.
In his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were lost "in a series of small fires".Of course the insurance company refused to pay, giving the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal way.
The lawyer brought the case to the court and out of everybody's expectation, he actually won! At the end of the trial the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was crazy.But the judge said that the lawyer held a policy   from the company in which it had promised that the cigars were insured and that it would insure them against fire.Because the company didn't say what is considered to be unacceptable fire, it had to pay the claim.
Rather than put up with long and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the punishment and paid $ 15 ,000 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the "fires."
After the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested and accused him of arson  .With his own insurance claim from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was charged with burning his insured possessions on purpose and was sentenced to 24 months in prison and a $ 24,000 fine.
