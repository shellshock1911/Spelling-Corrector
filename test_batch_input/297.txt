People seem to have a natural need for friends and with good reason. Friends increase your enjoyment of life and relieve feelings of loneliness. They even can help reduce stress and improve your health. Having good friends is especially helpful when you are going through any kind of hard time such as when you are experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, or depression.
When you are with good friends you feel good about yourself, and you are glad to be with them. A friend is someone who --
*you like, respect, and trust, and who likes, respects and trusts you
*doesn't always understand you, but accepts and likes you as you are, even as you grow and change
*allows you the space to change, grow, make decisions, and even make mistakes
*listens to you and shares with you both the good times and the bad times
*respects your need for secrets, so you can tell them anything
*lets you freely express your feelings and emotions without judging, teasing, or criticizing you
*accepts the limitations you have put on yourself and helps you to remove them
A person once said, "Friendship is a continuing source of bonding , releasing, and creating in yourself and with the other person. There is an emotional bond between the two people."
A good friend or supporter may or may not be the same age or the same sex as you, and may not have the same educational, cultural, or religious background, or share interests that are similar to yours. Friendships also have different depths. Some are closer to the heart and some more
, but they're all useful and good.
