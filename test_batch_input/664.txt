Do you want to be productive at work or at home? Here's what you should do.
1. Cut off television
I used to tell myself that I needed a break. So, when the kids slept I turned on the cable and watched whatever program that caught my fancy. Often, I found myself not watching, just channel-surfing. And I didn't end up watching a full program. I decided one day to just give up on TV as it made me sleep late and woke up tired.
If you want to be productive, cut off TV. You are better off reading a book. Without TV, I have managed to finish many books which I have bought but never read.
2. Limit Internet use
The other big distraction that can make you sleep late is the Internet. Probably because you will be checking your emails, updating your blog, watching YouTube, etc. Try limiting the use of it at home, or switch it to the morning session.
Nowadays, I check all my personal emails early in the morning. When I get into work, I find myself less tempted to check personal emails.
3. Know your priorities 
Really, it is all about the choices you make and the priorities you have. If you know it is competitive out there in the world, how can you be a better worker than the person who is also aiming for the position above you?
4. Rest early, rise early
Do you want to be productive? Rise early, read more books, have more energy, be more focused and set standards for others to catch up. It's as simple as that.
