I stood without moving, the door closed behind me, the walls hard and silent on both sides and him in front of me, looking into my face. His empty eyes grew a smile when he realized he would soon have all the money in my wallet. Looking downwards at his hands, I saw him take out a sharp, silvery object. Then in soft, low voice he said, "Come over here." Although I felt a wetness collect on my forehead, a collapsing of feeling in my stomach like a balloon losing air and a shiver  of fear in my legs, by now it was impossible to escape , so I fell into a chair beside him. Though as far as I know he would soon cut me, I raised my courage enough to say, "A little off the sides around my ears and shorten the top."
