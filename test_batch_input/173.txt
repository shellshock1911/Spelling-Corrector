Dear Ms. Saunders,
I am writing in regard to the Administrative Assistant position that is available at Trinity Client Publications.
I have just completed the Office Administration program at Frayer College and am excited to try my skills in the real world. I have a good knowledge of basic computer programs, and have writing, editing, and critical thinking skills. I work well with tight deadlines, and am a highly-motivated self-starter.
At past jobs I have checked and corrected letters, taken notes, and made plans. I also communicated with customers. I am efficient and accurate in all my work. Please consult the enclosed resume  for additional information about my work experience.
Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. If you have any questions you can reach me at (566) 734-4470 or at akwak@cvva.ca.
Sincerely,
Alice Kwak
