"Sometimes you just get a strict teacher. Instead of letting others know that this isn't your favorite class. Make an effort to show your teacher you are doing your best."
--Jocelyn Howard, 16
"Learn to put your activities in order of importance. School comes first, and if you just study as soon as you get home, it's OK. You can also relax and play computers or do the other things you enjoy. But don't settle for   just  _ Try hard! And don't be afraid to get help from teachers."--April Madlangbanyan, 17
"If you have trouble getting along with a specific teacher, pray about it. Ask God to help you see that teacher through HIS EYES, not your own. And talk with that teacher. Good communication can strengthen any relationship-even with a hard-to-get-along-with teacher."                                                                                                                                        --Lisa Shaw, 21
"Being a good student means being organized. Remember to bring all your supplies, everything-to each class every day. Make sure that you'll never skip   class. And when you're in class,really pay attention! Don't let yourself daydream or write notes to friends. Completing your homework on time is also important."                       --Victoria Walsh, 16[%~&:*@]
"When you're having trouble getting along with a certain teacher, stay calm! You may not agree with him or her, but you've got to remember the teacher is the authority   figure. So make sure that you're respectful and open-minded. Ask for a specific time the two of you can talk. Explain yourself and address   problem, not the teacher."
--Amanda Baken, 18
"Being a good student means studying often, not just cramming   before a test. Identify   your weak areas. For example, maybe you don't have good reading skills or it's hard for you to take notes. Once you identify what your weakness is, ask for help in these specific areas. Be willing to go in early or stay after school to get extra help. Go into the school year knowing that being a good student will require time and effort!"
