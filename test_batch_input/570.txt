There are about 15,000--20,000 species of butterflies all over the world.They can be found on every continent except Antarctica.
To go to sleep,butterflies look for a safe place like the underside of a leaf or a branch,for example.Most butterflies sleep alone,but there are also species sleeping in groups.Poisonous butterflies have a particular smell that probably protects them better when they sleep together.It is also useful not to change the group'S sleeping place because a predator who attacked a poisonous butterfly one time won't do this again.There is only a limited number of predators in an area so there is only a limited number to" educate" if the sleeping place stays the same.
One species from Costa Rica whose scientific name is Marpesia berania sleeps in groups on a leaf.If one butterfly of the group is disturbed,it opens its wings and touches its neighbors.Being touched,they open their wings as well and so the whole group is informed about the danger and Can escape together.
The speed of their flight depends on the way the butterfly flies:Blues and Whites normally have speeds under 8 km/h,the speed of Fritillaries is between 16 to 40 km/h and some Skippers reach speeds up to 60 km/h.
Besides warning and scaring predators with color1s butterflies fly in a special way.The direction of their amazing flight is hard to predict.When they hear the sounds of a bat,the ones flying at night start a zigzag flight in all directions:up and down,left and right.So it gets hard for the bat to catch them.
In the dark when color1s don't function,some poisonous butterflies make clicking noises to warn bats that they are poisonous.Of course other species copy this sound to produce the protective effect,too.
