Every night I have to go over the books he has learned from in class, signing each page to show the teacher that I have understood what the children have already done. 
My child waits for me to play with him while I have my nose buried in his books. 
"Have you done your homework yet, mom?"
At least once a week we are handed fliers about various events going on, while the homework keeps piling up. 
And while my son throws his books in his bag every day quite happily, it's my responsibility to check he has everything he needs, that his lunchbox is washed and dry, that his water bottle is clean and full. 
My child is sailing through the classes, especially, of course, English, in which they have been asked to choose an English name and decorate a nameplate for lessons. 
My son, who already has an English name, has chosen another one, Harry. 
Wu Shenhao, a little boy from my child's kindergarten, has chosen Helen. The girl who sits next to him has chosen Peter. 
English is the one lesson I am not trapped with illegible  requests and homework. The kind teacher has decided to let us off this one. 
With 42 children in a class I have piles of respect for the teachers who sustain their devoted, detailed training of these young minds. 
Perhaps with the homework load they are causing some kind of revenge on the parents who have produced these little charges, and in doing so have caused them all this work.  
To my little boy, it's all good fun with a bit of writing and numbers thrown in. 
He loves most of it, especially the weekly flagraising ceremony, which, while a little surprising to the little ones, is at least accompanied by lively music and bright red flags.
