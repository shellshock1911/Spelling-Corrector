Educating girls quite possibly gets a higher rate of return than any other deal available in the developing world.Women's education may be unusual field for economists, but increasing women's contribution to development is actually as much an economic as a social project.And economics, with its emphasis on incentives  , provides an explanation for why so many girls lose the chance of education.
Parents in low-income countries don't send their daughters to school because they do not expect them to make an economic contribution to the family: girls grow up only to marry into somebody else's family and bear children.Girls are thus seen as less valuable than boys and are kept at home to do housework while their brothers are sent to school----the prophecy   becomes self-fulfilling, trapping women in a vicious circle  of abandonment.
An educated mother, on the other hand.has greater earning abilities outside the home and faces an entirely different set of choices.She is likely to have fewer but healthier children and can insist on the development of all her children, ensuring that her daughters are given a fair chance.The education of her daughters then makes it much more likely that the next generation of girls, as well as of boys.will be educated and healthy. The vicious circle is thus transformed into a virtuous circle  .
Few will argue that educating women has great social benefits.But it has enormous economic advantages as well.Most obviously, there is the direct effect of education on the wages of female workers.Wages rise by 10 to 20 per cent for each additional year of schooling.Such big returns are impressive by the standard of other available deal, but they are just the beginning.Educating women also has a significant impact on health practices, including family planning.
