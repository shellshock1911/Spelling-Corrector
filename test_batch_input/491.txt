"Time is a problem for children," states a news report for a new Swiss watch. Children in some countries "learn time slowly" because "they don't wear watches" and "parents don't really know how to teach them time." The children grow up with this _ and become adults-and then can't get to work on time. Is there an answer to this problem? Of course-it's the Flick Flak, made by a famous Swiss watch company.
The Flick Flak is being marketed as something teaching watch for children aged 4 to 10. The watch itself does not teach children how to tell time, of course; it merely "takes their imagination" by presenting the "hour" hand as a beautiful red girl named Flak and the "minute" hand as a tall blue boy named Flick. Flick points to related "blue" minutes on the dial, while Flak points to "red" hour numbers. The characters and colors combined with parental help, are supposed to teach young children how to tell time.
The watch comes equipped with a standard battery and a nylon band  . Peter Lipkin, the United States sales manager for the Flick Flak, calls it "childproof: if it gets dirty you can throw the whole watch in the washing machine." The product is being sold in select department stores in Europe, Asia and the United States for a suggested price of $25. Parents who buy the watch may discover that it is one thing to tell time; it's quite another for them to be on time.
