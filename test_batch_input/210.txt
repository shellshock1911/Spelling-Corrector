As the Labor Day public holiday starts this year, Chinese travel agencies have a new right: to blacklist poorly-behaved tourists in an effort to prevent ill manners. Tourists will be blacklisted for uncivilized behaviors such as acting antisocially on public transport, damaging private or public property, disrespecting local customs, or _ historical exhibits. According to the regulations issued by the China National Tourism Administration (NTA), tour guides and leaders have the right to report on bad behaviors to the government. The new regulations mainly come from the growing concern about the ill manners of Chinese tourists abroad.
In 2015, more than 83 million Chinese people traveled overseas, up 18 percent from the year 2014, according to the China Tourism Academy. But even as they travel farther, the Chinese tourists continue to take bad habits with them. From damaging ancient Egyptian temples to letting children defecate in the middle of airports, Chinese tourists have earned a bad fame. Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang even stressed the need for Chinese tourists to behave better while traveling overseas so as to protect China's image abroad.
Now with the latest regulations, Chinese travelers should have no excuse for rude behavior. According to the guidelines issued by NTA, when using the restroom, Chinese tourists are asked not to forget to flush the toilet after using it.
The guidelines also remind tourists of not fighting with others when they want to take pictures at tourist attractions. When flying, the guidelines advise travelers not to take life vests away from airplanes. Chinese tourists are also encouraged to be respectful of local customs wherever they travel.
Yet, with a very short history of traveling overseas, it is not surprising that many Chinese tourists behave badly on their foreign trips. We should give them time to change.
