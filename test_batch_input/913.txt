One day Bill went to eat at a restaurant in London.Suddenly a young woman sat down beside him.Bill could not think what she wanted.She did not look very happy.Bill asked her what was wrong."The problem is," she began.But then she stopped.She didn't find it easy to tell Bill about it, it seemed.
"My husband and I wanted to meet here for lunch at 12," she said at last, "but he hasn't come."
"Well, don't you know where he is? Can you ring him up?"
"No, I can't." said the woman, "And I have had lunch now and I can't pay the bill.Because I haven't got any money with me."
"Never mind, I'll pay the bill for you.You can pay me back later." Bill said."If you give me your address, I'll send you the money as soon as I get home." With these words she left the restaurant.
A few weeks later, when Bill was having lunch at another restaurant, he suddenly heard a familiar voice, "Excuse me.May I just sit here for a moment?" Bill turned round.It was the same young woman again.This time she was talking to a man with gray hair at a table not far from the gate.Bill smiled at the woman and got up from his chair and walked across the room.
