To many students, high school is just a basic routine. You go to class in the morning, take a break for lunch and go home in the afternoon.
This isn't quite that simple for pupils at Royal West Academy. As if classes and homework weren't already enough, students are also required to complete a range of extracurricular activities, or ECAs.
The range of ECAs being offered at the school is various, including everything from guitar and jewelry-making clubs, fund-raising marches, to student committees, swimming and tennis.
"I love ECAs. I'm so happy we have them," said grade 11 student Adrienne, who is a soccer player and member of the graduation committee. "They motivate the students, and they're a great bonding experience. I think that without them, not half as many students would be joining up for the soccer team."
Requiring students to complete ECAs is a sign of the times. That's because young people are preparing for the future in ways that weren't considered necessary before. This is an era when ECAs are seen as important. Whether it's for leadership experience, sports, craft skills or volunteer these things are seen as rounding out the individual and improving their future.
ECAs can also help students discover their likes and dislikes. But as the old song says, you can't always get what you want, especially when so many students are all trying to sign up for the most popular activities.
ECAs can cut into study and homework time if you're not careful. You really have to get organized or you'll fall apart.
