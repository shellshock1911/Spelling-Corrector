Jason sat on his couch as he normally did, not knowing that his life would change on that beautiful autumn day. As he left his house, he thought of everything that he needed to buy, made a list, and then got into his car. As he began to drive, his mind came to the fight that he had with his girlfriend. When he finally began to focus back on his driving, it was just a moment too late. He had hit a car and there was no way to stop what happened next.
The smell of gasoline filled the air, and he knew that he needed to get out of the car. Strong arms began to pull him out and he saw a woman who was screaming. A stranger handed a child to her and the child was injured. Afterwards, they were taken to the hospital.
By chance, he was in a room on the same floor as the mother and child. For the first time in his life, he was truly sorry. He made his way to their room, looked at the upset mother straight in the eye and said simply, "Please forgive me and I didn't mean for this to happen." The woman stood there, completely shocked, and said, "It took a lot of courage for you to ask for forgiveness, and my daughter is always saying to me to just forgive and forget. I will give you forgiveness."
Jason began to cry, and not knowing what to do, he threw his arms around the mother of the injured girl and told her that he would do anything they needed. To make it easier for him, the woman told him her and her daughter's names. Then they sat there and talked for hours, watching her daughter sleep. They are now friends and are enjoying the wonderful friendship, all because of forgiveness.
