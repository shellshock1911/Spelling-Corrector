It would have been a success story if Fullerton High School senior Fernando Rojas, the son of Mexican immigrants whose schooling stopped in the eighth grade, was accepted to college. But the 17-year-o1d achieved a surprising clean sweep--he was accepted to every Ivy League  school.
"I didn't think I could get into any," Rojas told The Orange County Register on Saturday. "When I got all eight, it was a blessing and a curse because I had to choose. I was excited and scared and everything at the same time."
The first call came from Yale University in February. Within weeks calls, emails and letters followed from Dartmouth College, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, Columbia University, Harvard University and Princeton University. Rojas also was accepted by Stanford University and two nearby schools, the University of California, Irvine, and California State University, Fullerton.
He is one of four children of Raul Rojas and Mafia, who moved to Fullerton from Jalisco, Mexico in the early 1980s.
A national speech and debate champion, Rojas reasoned that if he applied to the eight Ivy League schools, he might get into one. Sal Tinajero, Rojas'speech and debate coach at Fullerton, told the newspaper that Rojas is a hardworking self-starter who thrives   on competition. _ Tinajero said.
After visiting several campuses, he settled on Yale, which costs $64, 000 a year with room and board. He is responsible for $6,000; Yale scholarships and federal grant money cover the rest.
He'll mostly take it easy during the summer before heading to Yale in late August. He's considering majoring in Latin American studies and perhaps a career as a lawyer or in international affairs.
