I don't want to upset you, but nobody can ever find out what day is going to be the last. And so it's better to live each day of your life as if it is the last. I'm not telling you to quit your job and spend all your money on traveling. But you can live your life to its fullest by adding some simple things to each day. It doesn't matter what is going on, but it does matter how you feel about it. Here is my recipe for the best day on Earth!
A Handful of Happiness
Where can you find it? Take a look inside of yourself! Happiness doesn't come from the outside, it is within you. Each moment your life gives you a lot of opportunities to be happy. If you want to see them, you will. If you don't, it's up to you.
A Handful of Love
Love is the harmony of your soul. A little love can make a big difference to the whole world. We are one. Everyone and everything deserve your love as well as you do.
A Handful of Dreams
Feel free to dream big dreams and make small steps towards them. You are the creator of your life. Every time you are doing something to achieve your goals you are growing.
A Handful of Creativity
Try to be creative in everything you do. Try to do your best every time you are doing something. Do not be afraid to use your imagination. It's such a pleasure to do something new. Feel the joy of creation!
A Handful of Magic
Do you believe in magic? Well, you should. Life is full of miracles. In fact, life itself is a big miracle. There are so many things that are beyond our understanding.
-- Albert Einstein
Celebrate every day of your life! Let the spirit of holiday fill each corner of your heart. Why not? You live your life to its fullest and move towards your dreams!
