Most people go to a doctor in their own town or suburb . But people in the Australian outback can't get to a doctor quickly. The nearest doctor is sometimes hundreds of kilometers away so they have to call him on a two-way radio. This special doctor is called the "flying doctor". He visits sick people by plane.
When someone is very sick, the doctor has to fly to the person's home. His plane lands on a flat piece of ground near the person's house. Sometimes the doctor has to take the patient to hospital. Flying doctors take about 8,600 people to hospital each year.
However, most of the time the person isn't very sick, and the doctor doesn't have to visit. He can give advice on the radio from the office at the flying doctor center. He can tell the patient to use some medicine from a special medicine chest  . There is one of these chests in every home in the outback. Each bottle, tube and packet in the chest has a number. The doctor often says something like this," take two tablets  from bottle 5 every four hours."
