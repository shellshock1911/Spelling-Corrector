The child of today owes much of its pleasant school life to the work of Maria Montessori and others who felt as she did.
 Maria Montessori was born in 1870 in northern prefix = st1 /Italy. Both her parents were well educated.
 While Maria was a student, she took great interest in the study of the particular nature of the child's mind. It came to her that small children should have freedom  to learn.
 Maria became a doctor and a professor at RomeUniversity. In 1907, after working with backward students, she was given a chance to try out her ideas on children. There were sixty children, aged three to six, in the Children's House. The rooms were bright and color1ful. Maria let the children make their own choice of what they wanted to do and work with their own speed. They became busy, peaceful and happy.

She thought that true education, providing  for the real needs of the child, would produce wise and happy grown-ups and therefore a peaceful world.
