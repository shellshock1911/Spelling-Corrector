Speed-reading is an essential skill in the Internet age. We skim over articles, e-mails to try to grasp key words and the essential meaning of a certain text. Continuous information from our electronic devices, it would be impossible to cope if we read word by word, line by line. But a new trend calls on people to unplug and enjoy reading slowly, listing benefits beyond intellectual development.
A recent story from The Wall Street Journal reported on a book club in Wellington, New Zealand, where members meet in a cafe and turn off their smart phones. They sink into cozy chairs and read in silence for an hour.
Some of these benefits have been backed up by science. For example, a study of 300 elderly people published by the journal Neurology last year showed that regular engagement in intellectual activities like slow-reading slowed the rate of memory loss later in life.
Yet technology has made us less attentive readers. Screens have changed our reading patterns from the linear, left-to-right sequence to a wild skimming and skipping pattern as we hunt for important words and information. The Internet may have made us stupider, says Patrick Kingsley from The Guardian.  
Slow reading means a return to an uninterrupted, linear pattern, in a quiet environment free of distractions. Aim for 30 minutes a day, advises Kelly from The Atlantic. "You can spend half an hour pretty easily if only during your free moments -- whenever you find yourself automatically firing up your laptop to check your favorite site, or scanning Twitter for something to pass the time-you pick up a meaningful work of literature."
