Robots that can chat,find misplaced glasses,draw aeroplanes and play with your children are drawing thousands of visitors' attention during an expo in Tokyo as Japan adapts to changes in society.
Robots,such as the soundsensitive Chapit,answer simple questions and even joke with people to help the lonely fight loneliness and stay active in old age.
"Many older people in Japan live alone and have no one to talk to," said Kazuya Kitamura,a representative of the expo organizer."Communication robots accompany people and don't mind listening to the same stories over and over again."
While Chapit,a relatively simple robot,managed to _ a corporate partner,many researchers,such as Kiyoshi Matsumoto,a professor at the University of Tokyo,struggle to interest sponsors for more expensive projects.
Matsumoto's "Personal Mobility Robot",equipped with four cameras and a sensor to recognize the user's centre of gravity,is designed to help the elderly move around without pressing buttons,using joysticks  or rotating  wheels as in traditional wheelchairs.
The robot can also help find misplaced glasses by identifying them with a sensor.
"We have developed a robot that can assist many people,but because of the high cost,we still haven't found a sponsor,"said Matsumoto,who added that the cost of the machine,if massproduced,would be comparable to that of a car.
"In the current economic environment there are few companies willing to invest in such a costly project," he said.
Other robots,such as the awardwinning "DiGRO" can support busy parents who have little time to play with their children.
The robot can use the Internet to find a simple image and then draw pictures,keeping children company while their parents work.
Japan has one of the world's fastestageing societies and the government predicts that by 2050 the proportion of people over 65 will reach 40 percent.
