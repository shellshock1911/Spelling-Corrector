I serve coffee at a diner in Texas. I often see a look of isolation   in my customers' eyes. They come in the front door, wander to the counter, pick up the menu, and look around the diner for something they can't short-order: a connection.
In an age of online chat, online shopping and even online school, it's no wonder people come into the diner starving for human connection. Most of my customers ask me about the happenings in my life when I serve up their eggs and meat.
One day, I walked back to the smoking section to pass around a fresh pot of coffee. There was a woman who had been sitting in a corner booth for at least three hours. She asked me, "How much is just one breakfast taco  ?" I told her I'd never served just one by itself. Going back to the kitchen I thought about her tired eyes. I offered her a free pancake breakfast. She asked to borrow the money for bus and promised to return and pay me back. I handed over tip money from my pocket. She smiled on her way out the front door.
Three weeks later she returned my two dollars. She had gotten a job and a friend's bed to sleep on. She offered to buy me breakfast on my break!
This kind of thing gets me wondering if something as simple as a breakfast can bring about a small change in society, then why not take it even further and see if one act of friendliness can start to make peace? I believe it can. Peace begins with one person but spreads. When I connect with my neighbors, they return it in kind.
So I believe in friendliness and an open ear. For me, it starts with making eye contact when I pour coffee and ask my customers, "How are you doing?" and then listen to their answer. My job is to take care of customers, but I also believe we're to take care of each other.
