When someone says , "Well , I guess I'll have to go to face the music," It doesn't mean he is planning to go to a concert . It is something far less pleasant , like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that , and why you did not do this or that . Sour  music , indeed , but it has to be faced .
The phrase "to face the music" is familiar to every American , young and old . It is at least 100 years old . Where did the expression come from ?
The first information comes from the American writer James Fenimore Cooper . He said--in 1851--that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings  to go on stage . After they got their clue to go on , they often said , "It's time to go to face the music." And that is exactly what they did --face the orchestra which was just below the stage .
An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly , especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out .
So, "to face the music" came to mean : having to go through something , no matter how unpleasant the experience might be , because you knew you had no choice .
The other explanation comes from the army . Men had to face inspection by their leader . The soldiers worried about how well they looked . Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection ? Still , the men had to go out , and face the music of the band , as well as the inspection . What else could they do ?
