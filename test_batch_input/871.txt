Any list of the world's top ten most famous paintings will surely include da Vinci's Mona Lisa.Part of the painting's attraction is its mystery .
Those lucky enough to have a view of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre often stare in awe , surprised by the smile that seems to flicker .Staring at a reproduction of the work produces the same effect.Now she's smiling, then she's not.
What's the deal with Mona Lisa's smile?
Harvard scientist Margaret Livingstone is pretty sure she's solved the puzzle.After careful studies on human brains, Livingstone reasoned that the famous painting's flickering smile is caused by the way human beings see.
Our eyes use two separate regions  to see.One is central vision(;), used to see colors and pick out details such as fine print.The other is the vision around, used to observe lights, shadows, black and white contrasts.
When we look at a person's face, according to Livingstone, we usually focus centrally on the eyes.Staring at Mona Lisa's eyes, our less accurate vision notices the mouth, picking up shadows from the cheekbones.The shadows play tricks, looking like a smile.But when we look directly at the mouth, our central vision doesn't see the shadows, and so the smile suddenly disappears.As our eyes observe different parts of the painting, Mona's smile seems to show up or disappear.
Did da Vinci intend to create this flickering smile effect? Perhaps.In any case, he was talented enough to paint shadows so good as to puzzle viewers for centuries.Meanwhile, Mona Lisa will keep smiling.And not.
