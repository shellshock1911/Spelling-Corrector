There are about a billion bicycles in the world,twice as many as there are cars.But if Karl von Drais.the Baron of Sauerbronn(17851851) hadn't been such a lazy person,the bicycle may never have been invented at all.
    Although he had a very important title (and was also a qualified and skillful engineer),the Baron was in fact a forest ranger,in other words,a gardener with responsibility for a very large garden.He was in charge of several hundred square kilometers of royal garden and forests in Central Germany.
    In 1817.he invented a "running machine" that would help him get round the  _ more quickly.The machine was made of wood,and had two wheels,which were the same size.The machine had a wooden frame and a leather seat.The rider rode the machine like a horse,but with his feet on the ground.After running for a while,he could then take his feet off the ground and glide along.It was possible to change direction by controlling the front wheel.but there were no brakes! In 1863,a Frenchman called Pierre Lallement attached pedals to the front wheel of a bicycle,and the modern idea of a bicycle was born.
    Every generation sees new designs and new interest in bicycles.Mountain bikes,for example,transformed the way people thought about cycling and introduced a new sport,which was accepted into the Olympics in 1996.
    New materials such as titanium and carbon fiber are now used to build strong,lightweight machines and combined brake and gear systems have been developed.Englishman Chris Boardman astonished the world in the 1990s with his carbon fiber Lotus bicycle,winning Olympic gold in the 4,000 meters track pursuit in Barcelona.More recently,the Great Britain team took several medals at the Athens Olympics
    For most people.however.the bicycle remains what it has always been-a pollution-free way of taking exercise and getting from A to B.
