My husband had just bought a new washing machine for me. I decided to use it and I washed a lot of things.
    Everything worked well, but I found one of my husband's socks missing. I looked everywhere for it, but I couldn't find it anywhere.
    The next morning, I got ready for school as usual. When the bell rang, the students came in. I greeted them first and then told them what we were going to do that day. When I turned around to write on the blackboard, the class broke out a roar! They laughed and laughed. They laughed so much, in fact, that I was afraid the headmaster would be into seeing all this.
     I asked the class to stop, but the more I talked, the more they laughed. I decided to pay no attention to them and I continued to write on the blackboard. When I did this, they roared even more.
    Finally, the teacher who had the room next to mine came in to see what all the laughter was about. When he came in, he started laughing, too!
   "Good heavens," I said. "Will someone please tell me what is so funny?'
   "Oh, God," said the teacher. "You have a brown sock to the back of your skirt!"
   So that's how I found my husband's missing sock.
   "Oh, well," I said to the class. "Let's just say you have had an unforgettable lesson on static  electricity."
