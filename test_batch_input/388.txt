A few weeks ago a group of scientists produced a report about global warming and the natural world.They wanted to find out if global warming was dangerous for plants and animals.The scientists were surprised by what they found.They say that during the next 50 years about 25% of land animals and plants will become extinct .More than 1 million plant and animal species will become extinct by 2050.
The head of the research team, Christ Thomas, who is professor of conservation biology at Leeds University, said the results of their research were frightening.More than 10% of all plants and animals will become extinct.It is too late to save many plants and animals because of the greenhouse gases that are already in the atmosphere.But the scientists say if we control greenhouse gases now, we could save many more plants and animals from extinction.
The scientists studied some areas of the world with a very rich biology.These areas were Europe, Australia, Central and South America, and South Africa.Their studies showed that species living in mountainous areas had a better chance of survival because they could move uphill to get cooler.In flat areas, such as deserts, plants and animals would have to move very long distances to get cooler, so they are in greater danger of extinction.The scientists found many surprising things.For example, they found that half of the 24 species  of butterfly they studied in Australia would soon become extinct.
