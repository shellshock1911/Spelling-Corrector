About 1,300 people from the army and air force of each side will participate in the exercise. The Russian forces would also send an airborne assault unit  to participate in the exercise, according to the Defense Ministry.
The more than 2,600 soldiers have conducted joint exercise before. From July 23 to 26, the troops will conduct the exercise at a training base in the Shenyang Military Area Command where theater-level command headquarters  of both sides will be established.
The deputy chief of general staff of Chinese armed forces Ma Xiaotian told reporters this morning that the Chinese military is well prepared for Sunday's joint anti-terror drill with Russia in a training base in Baicheng, Jilin Province.
The other four member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Takistan, Uzbekistan and the SCO's secretariat will send military observers.
