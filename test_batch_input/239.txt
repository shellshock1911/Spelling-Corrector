What's on
Although many parts of Asia have long been connected through trade along Silk Road and shared religious systems, there are strong regional differences. In addition to various languages, Asia has developed its cultural networks, patterns of government, technology and styles of artistic representation.
The diverse cultural life of Africa has been expressed through everyday cooking objects and unique works of art since ancient times. The Museum's collection of over 200,000 African items includes archaeological and contemporary material from across the continent.
