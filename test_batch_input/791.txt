To me,life without music would not be exciting.I realize that this is not true for everybody.Many people get along quite well without going to the concert,and listening to the record. But music plays an important part in everyone's life,whether he realizes it or not.Try to imagine,for example,what films or TV plays would be like without music.Would the feelings,the moving plot,and the greatest interests,be so interesting or dramatic? I'm not sure about it.
Now we have been speaking of music in its more common meaning--the kind of music we hear in the concert hall.We discover them in our everyday life too--in the rhythm of the sea,the _ of a bird in the woods and so on.So music surely has meaning for everyone,in some way or other.  And,of course,it has special meaning for those who have spent all their lives working on playing or writing music.
It is well said,"Through music a child enters a world of beauty,expresses himself from his heart,feels the joy of doing things alone,learns to take care of others,develops his mind and makes his body strong."
