When you are invited to attend a party in the West, the first important thing you need to know is that you should arrive late.
It is a great embarrassment to arrive at a party early or even on time. Therefore, unless you are the host of the party, you never want to be the first person present at a party. Why? Because others may think that you have no life or nothing better to do than wait for a party to start. Many people try to project an image of always being busy, which, whether true or not, has something to do with success. So, by arriving late, you are implying: "I live a full life and it's really exciting."
Therefore, an 8 o'clock party usually doesn't really start until maybe 9 o'clock, as everyone wants to be thought of as a busy and important person with lots of things to do. In other words, a party is one of those rare occasions in which your _ can actually hurt you. It's quite a strange thing, isn't it? Anyhow, remember to be late!
