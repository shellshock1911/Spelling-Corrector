Damage to Ozone layer Gets Worse
    In the middle of winter, when snow is falling in many parts of theprefix = st1 /United States, scientists have sounded a warning to people who plan to spend many hours in the sun this summer. The warning is: The sun's summertime rays  are more dangerous than once thought.
    A team of scientists from 80 nations recently reported to the United Nations that a layer  of ozone   in the atmosphere, which protects humans from harmful levels of ultraviolet  radiation, will be thinner over the United States this summer. The thinner layer allows more ultraviolet rays from the sun to reach Earth. The extra amount of ultraviolet radiation could cause an increase in the number of cases of skin cancer.
    Scientists first became concerned about the ozone layer in the mid-1980s when a hole was discovered in the layer above Antarctica during the winter. The hole was caused by chemicals used in refrigerators and air conditioners. When these chemicals are sent out into the atmosphere, they produce gases that destroy the ozone.
    Concern about the protective ozone layer rose more recently when data  from satellites and ground stations showed that ozone levels were dropping over areas other than Antarctica. Low ozone levels were recorded in the spring and summer over the United Statesand over other populated areas in the world.
    Although many countries have already begun stopping the use of ozone destroying chemicals, the new findings are expected to advance the timetable for a total ban  of the chemicals.
